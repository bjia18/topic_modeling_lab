AFAM,100,"This course will examine the history of African Americans from the Great Migration from the rural South to the urban centers of America beginning at the turn of the new century, the promise of greater opportunities in the aftermath of two World Wars, the catastrophic impact of the Great Depression of the 1930’s, the persistence of violence against blacks in the Jim Crow South and other American cities  during the post World War II period, the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement of the 1950’s and 60’s, and the growing racial consciousness that accompanied demands for empowerment  of black communities through the 1960’s and 70’s into the 21st Century. The artistic expressions of black playwrights, poets, visual and performing artists and filmmakers have been pivotal in understanding African American experience during the 20th Century and in the course, we will focus on a variety of artistic forms to examine this history."
AFAM,206,"The first part of this course will provide students with a broad overview of important sociological theories regarding work. We will read major theorists' (eg. Marx, Weber, DuBois) contributions to the study of work. We will use these works to answer fundamental questions such as: Why do we work? Who controls our labor? How does work influence our quality of life? The second part of this course focuses on how work has been racialized in the U.S. labor market. Specifically, students will be exposed to various themes in African-American labor history and class formation. Although the cases of racialized labor focus on African Americans, students will be exposed to the work experiences of other subaltern groups. Prerequisites for 200-level: One 100-level Social Science or African American Studies course. Prerequisites for 300-level: One 100-level and one 200-level (or higher) Social Science or African American Studies course."
AFAM,209,"This course will examine events in American history through the novels of African American writers, focusing on events and narratives such as: a slave revolt in the 1800s; the naval exploits of Robert Smalls during the Civil War; the black presence in wars fought by the United States from the American Revolution, WW I, WW II, to Vietnam; a Southern black family coming to terms with the legacy of slavery through the Jim Crow era; a young black girl's coming of age at the beginning of the Southern Civil Rights Movement in the late 1950s; stories of racial upheavals in the cities of Boston and Philadelphia during the 1970s & 1980s; and a dystopian novel of racial and political strife in Los Angeles during the not too distant future. For 200 level students the prerequisite is completion of Sem 1; for 300 level students the prerequisite is Sem 3.
"
AFAM,302,"This is an upper level African American Studies course that focuses on critical race theories and empirical research on African Americans in the U.S.  ""Traditional"" academic research on African-Americans documents and explains how racialized systems of inequality operate.  Critical race theory is different because it also explicitly articulates the need for social justice.  Various theoretical approaches will be applied to specific historical developments in U.S. racialized structures as they pertain to African Americans. We will begin by challenging and historicizing the concept of ""race.""  Our attention will then turn to various empirical studies on the position of African Americans within various institutions including, but not limited to labor market, wealth, legal system, education, housing, healthcare, politics, etc.  Then we will examine the various strands of racial ideology that have arisen to legitimate and perpetuate racialized structural inequality.  We spend the remainder of the semester closely examining the theoretical works regarding race which have emerged from legal studies, sociology, politics, and women's studies.  Prerequisites: AFAM 100, AFAM 209/309, AFAM 310, HIST 247, or SOC 115, or by permission of the instructor.

AFAM,307,"This course will explore the radical tradition in African-American thought.  Black radical thought has come to be associated with a diverse array of scholars, disciplines, and political ideologies.  Students will be introduced to historical and contemporary scholars and epistemologies that challenge the racialized structure of inequality observed as constraining the lives of Black Americans. This course will cover various traditions in Black radical thought including Black Nationalism, Black Feminism/Womanism, Black Anarchism, and Black Marxism.  
We will examine the work of scholars, organizations, and social movements such as Angela Davis, Derrick Bell, bell hooks, the Combahee River Collective, the Black Panthers, the Prison Abolition Movement, Black Lives Matter, and #SayHerName.
"
AFAM,308,"From slave rebellions to the contemporary #blacklivesmatter movement, African Americans have continuously attempted to combat oppressive conditions. This course explores contemporary iterations of Black resistance to racially discriminatory policing, the prison industrial complex, and neoliberal economic policies. We begin the course by mapping out how conservative, free-market economic ideology and practices marginalize and ""ghettoize"" large swaths of the Black community. The second part of the course focuses on state sanctioned discrimination and violence against Black bodies in policing. We then turn our attention to mass incarceration and its consequences for those labeled ""criminals"" and the communities they leave behind. The remainder of the course examines uprisings in Ferguson and Baltimore; the #blacklivesmatter and #sayhername movements; and the essential role Black women and LGBTQ individuals have played in these resistance movements.  Prerequisites: a previous AFAM course, SOC 115, HIST 147, or permission of the instructor."
AFAM,309,"This course will examine events in American history through the novels of African American writers, focusing on events and narratives such as: a slave revolt in the 1800s; the naval exploits of Robert Smalls during the Civil War; the black presence in wars fought by the United States from the American Revolution, WW I, WW II, to Vietnam; a Southern black family coming to terms with the legacy of slavery through the Jim Crow era; a young black girl's coming of age at the beginning of the Southern Civil Rights Movement in the late 1950s; stories of racial upheavals in the cities of Boston and Philadelphia during the 1970s & 1980s; and a dystopian novel of racial and political strife in Los Angeles during the not too distant future. For 200 level students the prerequisite is completion of Sem 1; for 300 level students the prerequisite is Sem 3.
"
AFAM,310,"This course will focus on the history and practice of black aesthetics, as they have evolved within fiction, poetry, drama and the visual arts from the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920's and 30's to the Black Arts Movement of the 1960's &70's and how these artistic expressions have been part of an ongoing conversation into the 21st Century regarding the representations of black American life in America. Prerequisites: Students must be sophomores or above and have taken at least one humanities course at the 200 level or above."
ANTH,100,"This course introduces students to the development of cultural anthropological theory and practice. It considers important anthropological topics such as myth, religion, gift exchange, totem/taboo, and kinship as a way to approach the comparative study of human societies and cultures. Specific topics include rival concepts of culture, critical senses of differences, and ways diversity is represented in distinctive world-views. The course also samples some current and long lasting issues in interpretive practices and critical theory. No prerequisites."
ANTH,105,"For many centuries, African societies nurtured a repertoire of visual, oral and material cultural practices that were embedded in the everyday life of its people. More recently, colonialism, globalisation, and transnationalism, have played a significant role in the presence and forms of public culture in African societies. The aims of this course are: (1) to explore how these forms of cultural presence that cut across, art, architecture, the city, film, fashion, music, television, oral traditions, leisure and consumption reflect Africa¿s own modernity; (2) to interrogate global circulation of cultural capital and the relations of power and agency inherent in such exchanges."
ANTH,200,"Cultural Studies analyzes how culture—the domain in which people search for meaning and construct identity—is subject to politicization and commodification. This course introduces students to the history, theories, and methods of cultural
studies, exploring fundamental concepts such as culture, power, ideology, and hegemony, and their relationships to the production of culture and identities. Crucial to this project will be a critical analysis of contemporary media (such as TV, romance novels, and advertisements). This course covers topics central to understanding our global society, including: The ways fashion and shopping construct identities; the political and cultural dimensions of global consumerism; the museum as a site for the making of elite culture; the functions served by corporate philanthropy; and the social construction of select spaces as cultural arenas. Throughout the course we consider the interplay of notions of race, class, and gender on national identities, and the relationships between popular and “high” culture. Prerequisite: Sophomore standing or permission of the instructor.
"
ANTH,202,"We will study the interconnections between language and other aspects of culture. These interconnections include the ways that language molds and transmits people's concepts about the world in which they live and the relations between themselves and others. We will study the connections between concepts of the world (or a culture's ""world view"") and the language spoken by examining vocabulary, metaphor, grammatical constructions, and other features of
language. No prerequisites."
ANTH,210,"This course examines the impact of colonialist invasions and conquests as well as neocolonial hegemony on tribal people. Direct and indirect consequences of colonialism will be discussed. Topics include changes in economies, political autonomy and independence, family and social systems, and religious beliefs. Readings will be drawn from studies of tribal societies in Africa, Asia, the Americas, and the Pacific. Prerequisite: One course in social studies."
ANTH,212,"This course explores the ways that indigenous and non-Western peoples are portrayed in popular commercial film. Through viewing films and texts about visual representation, we will consider questions such as: From whose point of view is the story told? Whose voices dominate the film's narrative and perspective? Are characters presented as multidimensional or stereotypical? The course will also focus on the ways that social and political issues involving indigenous peoples are presented. We will analyze the differences between films made with indigenous participation (as writers or directors) and those with no significant non-Western influence. Prerequisite: One course in Social Studies or Film."
ANTH,214,"This course examines Native American religious beliefs, practices, and philosophies. It begins with discussion of indigenous concepts of the spirit world and its relationship to human life and experience. Succeeding topics include beliefs about  personal contact with the spirit realm, rites of passage, Earth and  resource renewal, healing, and methods of achieving visionary experience. The causes, contents, and outcomes of Native revitalization movements
are also discussed, as are the effects of missionaries on aboriginal belief systems and Native conversions to Christianity. Texts include anthropological, historical, and life-history accounts  selected to be representative of Native nations in the Northeast (Iroquois, Montagnais), Great Plains (Hidatsa. Lakota), Southwest (Hopi, Navajo), Great Basin (Comanche), Northwest (Kwakiutl), and Arctic (Inuit). Prerequisite: One  course in social studies."
ANTH,217,"This course examines religious beliefs and experiences in ""traditional"" and complex societies. It stresses the interconnections between religion and other aspects of culture such as family and community life and economic and political systems. Topics include rituals marking individual and family events, attributes and functions of shamanistic and visionary experiences, ritual treatment of illness, and the social and political implications of revitalization movements.
Prerequisite: One 100-level course in social studies."
ANTH,222,"This course focuses on the vibrant, diverse urban cultures in Africa. Students will address in their exploration of African urban life the socio-economic forces that have contributed to these cities¿ creation, and explore urban residents¿ needs, desires, and dynamic interaction with these built environments. Colonization, urbanization, and migration will be examined to illustrate how town and country continue to be interlinked for urban Africans and to reveal how colonial and postcolonial state projects were imposed on and resisted by Africans in varied urban environments. We will discuss the means by which men, women, and youth locate their respective places in these urban spaces to examine the gendered, economic, religious, and creative aspects of city life from the perspective that anthropology can bring to this subject. The course will draw upon ethnographic work completed in cities primarily in sub-Saharan Africa, including Nairobi, Lusaka, Cape Town, Accra, Bamako, Abidjan, and Dakar to name a few. Prerequisites: ANTH 100 or prior completion of at least one 200-level social science course."
ANTH,223,"This course examines the life history, a form of ethnographic literature. Life histories straddle autobiography and biography, historiography and memoir, and constitute a chronicle of the storyteller's life as it is communicated to their audience, the anthropologist. We will examine the processes that lead to these informative, yet intimate, accounts of individual lives and so understand the value life histories have to empower their narrators and to broaden our knowledge of less examined populations, such as women, the sick, or the poor. We will champion life histories in this course, but will consider critiques of this widely popular method nonetheless. Our reflection on these texts will extend to the manner in which life histories exist as a testament to the worthwhile, but complex, friendships that arise during fieldwork between the narrator and the anthropologist. The course looks to life histories with an eye to content as well as construction, and so students will have the opportunity to collect a life history over the course of the semester."
ANTH,226,"People of Black African origin in North and South America have for long dominated African Diaspora discourse. While this group's presence is predominantly connected to the historical event of forced dispersal through slavery, an integral part of Africa's modernity is the constant voluntary as well as forced movement of its people within and out of the continent. Europe is one of such locations attracting a continuous flow of people from the African continent as well as from what Paul Gilroy calls the 'black Atlantic'. The loyalties, identities and presences of these established and emerging African constituencies shuttle between Europe and both the imagined and real Africa. These transnational subjects are challenging the dominant notion of diaspora consciousness as a matter of unrealised longing for return and establishment of strategically constructed ethnic solidarity under particular systems of domination. This course is interested in exploring the history of this African diaspora formation as well the social and political conditions under which it emerged. The course is interested in the ways in which this ongoing demographic and cultural formation is changing the face of Europe and how Europe is responding to this change.  

The course will utilise texts from a range of disciplinary perspectives as well as a number of films that have been made on Africans in Europe.
"
ANTH,227,"Africans have long found innovative ways to preserve their cultural, community, and personal autonomy, despite the many historical and contemporary forces that have sought to undermine these traditions, efforts and practices. The course content draws primarily from the many examples of Africans' resistance to European colonization, but also explores how those with lower social status or lesser power within African communities (e.g., women or ethnic or religious minorities) have created opportunities for agency and power. Drawing on texts, films and other sources, the course highlights examples from countries across the African continent, including Kenya, Nigeria, Gambia, Tanzania and Madagascar, among others, as well as contexts ranging from rural and agricultural initiatives, to women's collectives, men's barbershops, and nightclubs, to name a few. The various analytic and comparative lenses employed in this course include, but are not limited to, gender-identity, labor, family networks, and globalization.
"
ANTH,228,"According to Evans-Pritchard, the Azande in Africa believed granaries collapsed, crushing their victims, because they were directed to do so by a witch intent on harming the unsuspecting individual seated nearby. Since Evans-Pritchard's pioneering work in the 1930s, a new generation of scholars have emerged whose passions for the preternatural have led to the exploration of witchcraft, sorcery, possession, divination, rumor and gossip as a means to explain the inexplicable and restore equilibrium in an uncertain world. This course examines in a cross-cultural perspective how people create meaning, form community, and devise interpretations of their everyday lives via these diverse beliefs and practices. We will examine how witchcraft accusations are linked to ethnic tensions within nation-states and how these indictments are commentary upon indigenous societies' ambivalence toward modernity. Bewitchment, cannibalism, and zombification index the unequal distribution of resources within families or regions where internal and transnational migration are frequent and elsewhere have become a mode of expression in religious conversion narratives or highlight gender inequities. This course will consider participation in the various cults, such as the bori, and participants' possession by spirits whose origins reach beyond their homeland and extend centuries back in time. Whether these beliefs and practices manifest in localized settings or envelop entire nations, recourse to the preternatural remains a potent and persistent form of expression and interaction in the contemporary world."
ANTH,231,"A crucial aspect of the phenomenon of globalisation is the movement of people through processes of migration and transnationalism. `Imaging and Imagining Migration' follows the trajectories as well as public discourses surrounding such movement through the lens of documentary and fictive films. It will explore the politics of borders, diversity, transnational mobility, citizenship and remittances while also considering the ways in which alterity or difference is articulated through the varied visual documentation of the lives of migrant subjects.
"
ANTH,232,"This course examines cities and their inhabitants in a cross-cultural perspective as these dynamic environments shape and are shaped by their diverse populations. Students will be introduced to the development of Urban Studies from its late 19th century origins in the United States and Europe to the current interdisciplinary focus on the various facets of city life today. We will explore those social, economic, political, and religious forces that have contributed to the creation of varied urban centers that operate as administrative and commercial headquarters, sacred sites, centers for recreation and festival, and global metropolises with influence that extends beyond national borders. Topics that will be discussed include migration and immigration; licit and illicit economic activities; urban violence; the configuration of space with its links to power; expressive culture; and the complex class, ethnic, gender, and racial dimensions found in cities. We address urban life through ethnographic works centered on Ireland, Ghana, Nigeria, Thailand, Bolivia, Brazil, and the United States. Prerequisite: one 100-level social studies course or permission of instructor."
ANTH,233,"This course examines contemporary issues of Japan from a global perspective using scholarly readings, novels and films on Japanese culture and society, We will cover a wide variety of topics related to everyday life in Japan, including class, gender, sexuality, immigration, popular culture,  and contemporary literature. Issues explored will include, but not be limited to, the construction of gender and sexuality, the process of identity formation, minority relations, the complexity of power relationships, the contested relationship between globalization and localization, and the dangers of ethnocentrism in the Japanese context.  Reading assignments, films, and class discussions will introduce students to major concepts and research methods in social-cultural anthropology while fostering a deeper understanding of contemporary Japan. The broad and interdisciplinary introduction to contemporary Japan provided by this course will be ideal for students seeking a general introduction to Japanese society and culture as well as those seeking a solid background for advanced Japan studies."
ANTH,234,"This course explores connections between what we eat and who we are through cross-cultural study of the personal identities and social groups that are formed via food production, preparation, and consumption. We will examine food and culture through stories and case studies focused on the particular topics of fasting, feasting, and famine. We learn how fasting is a practice tied to spirituality, in some contexts, or physical aesthetics in others. Feasting, too, is associated with religious celebrations and holidays, as well as to cycles of planting and harvesting. Finally, famines mark times of scarcity that highlight environmental crises and global economic inequities, but famine also calls to attention human resilience and capacity for creativity. We will explore these themes through an interdisciplinary lens as well as through food writing and creative non-fiction."
ANTH,235,"This course examines collective social action in response to crises and transformations in societies, with a particular focus on millenarian thinking, i.e., the belief that following a major transformation everything will be different, due either to rapture (the rising up of a new, and better, society) or to rupture (the destruction of existing, and good, social order). Various examples of millenarian thinking, including apocalyptic expectations as found in major world and syncretic religions and throughout history and across cultures, are examined. These belief systems often exemplify a wish for or fear of a complete reconfiguration of society through supernatural intercession. We explore the pacifist and violent dimensions of these movements through case studies that include the Shakers, the Peoples Temple Agricultural Project (AKA ""Jonestown""), and Aum Shinrikyo. Also of interest to us are millenarian movements stemming from changes provoked by colonial conquest, including the cargo cults in the Pacific Islands, the events surrounding the Boxer Rebellion in China, the Native American Ghost Dance, and the Santa Brígada in Brazil. Prerequisite: One 100-level Social Studies course and permission of the instructor."
ANTH,316,"Contemporary societies and cultures are experiencing an intensity of visible and aesthetic forms such as architecture, mass media, digital media, fashion, food products and more. Human subjects animate, inhabit and utilise these forms in very creative and impressive ways. In looking at this human relation to the social and material world, as cultural critics and social scientists, how can we account for the elegance as well as disagreements that is the theatre of this contemporary society? As artists, how can we imbue and inform our creative practice with the type of critical rigor required for an immersive engagement with contemporary everyday life? These are questions this interdisciplinary course asks. It seeks to make affect central to social science research agenda, while locating fieldwork, textual and qualitative analysis within creative art practice.

The course will utilise texts from a range of disciplinary perspectives including visual anthropology, visual culture, art and art history and cultural studies.
"
ANTH,317,"Does a treasured family heirloom hold the same importance in the life of its owner as a newly purchased item of clothing or technology? Do some objects contaminate those with whom they come into contact, while others have medicinal powers or bestow good fortune? In what circumstances are objects and owners' inseparable? This course examines material culture, or things, from two related perspectives: the object and its owner. As Appadurai observes, ""objects have social lives"" that are sometimes independent from their owners. Objects such as kula shells are treasured by their temporary owners and desired by others because they have a lengthy and renowned history of circulation between the Pacific's Trobriand Islands, whereas some Pacific Northwest Indians amass objects only to give them away in a ritualized ceremony--a Potlach--in order to become ""big men."" In certain societies the presence of key resources, such as designer clothing or cooking implements, permits their possessors to have social lives that lead to the expansion of social networks and community building or political advancement. In this course, we will examine a range of theories that correspond to these related approaches to material culture. From classic texts on circulation and exchange to theories on materiality, consumption and object fetishism, our investigation of objects and owners looks at an array of case studies from across the globe to better understand the life of objects and the lives objects engendered in order to illuminate connections between people and possessions. Prerequisite: One 200-level course in social studies or permission of instructor."

To further our exploration of these subjects we will look to our own history and do so through a fieldtrip to Salem, Massachusetts to examine the social, economic, and religious underpinnings the 17th century witchcraft trials. Whether these beliefs and practices manifest in localized settings or envelop entire nations, recourse to the preternatural remains a potent and persistent form of expression and interaction in the historic and contemporary world. Prerequisites for this course are completion of one anthropology course and completion of Sophomore Seminar. Students may also seek permission of instructor."
ANTH,330,"Individuals in communities impacted by dispossession and displacement access multiple forms of redress to come to terms with the upheaval and change in their lives. By drawing on ethnographic case studies from across the globe, this course examines how individuals and communities look for relief from and explanations for their upheaval and the means by which they receive compensation for their losses and seek to restore equilibrium to their lives. Of particular interest in this course are the ways in which social relations, identities, and gender are impacted by the processes of disruption and restoration. The course will also examine the complex causes and characteristics of those events leading to dispossession and displacement, as well as the local, national, and international actors involved. An anthropological exploration will enable us to understand the complex and often long-ranging causes and consequences of dispossession and displacement, including humans' capacity for resilience, forgiveness, and rebirth. Prerequisites: Junior or Senior standing or completion of Sophomore Seminar and permission of the instructor.

ARTH,100,"This course is an introduction to the practice of art historical analysis. We use several writing techniques to investigate the process of looking at art. The objects we analyze are taken from a variety of periods, cultures, and media. We focus mostly on 19th- and 20th-century modern art. This includes works by Impressionists such as Claude Monet; Post-Impressionists Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin; American modernists Georgia O'Keeffe, Jacob Lawrence, and Jackson Pollock; and postmodernist Barbara Kruger. We compare our own observations to primary sources--writings on art by artists' contemporaries such as poets and critics, as well as the artists themselves. We think carefully about the role of language and how it can enrich our experience of art. We consider some basic questions in approaching art's ""history,"" including the art object's relationship to specific historical events. The course moves toward the integration of careful looking, creative writing, original thinking, and historical grounding. Students regularly read their writing aloud for class appreciation and critique. Longer paper assignments are written on topics which students choose. No prerequisites."
ARTH,102,"This course, the second half of the western art survey, considers developments in “western” art from the year 1400 to the present and the art that results from selected encounters with global cultures.  We focus on the changing roles of art and the artist in society; on art as the expression of individual, social, political and cultural values; on stylistic issues; and on the relationships between art and philosophy, history, and politics (both high politics and cultural politics).  There are no prerequisites for this course; it is an excellent introduction to art history for students with no previous exposure.

ARTH,103,"The nude is a defining motif in the art and thought of classical Greece. This course examines and analyzes the principles and meanings of ""ideal form"" and their impact and power in the development of Western ideas and art, focusing on the ideas of rationality, idealism, symmetry, and universality. Does the ""spirit"" of the nude originate in the Apollonian or the Dionysian; in the rational or the irrational?
How do our contemporary understandings of the body, of sexuality, and of what it means to be human illuminate, contribute to, or obscure our understanding of these principles? This course satisfies one half of the arts requirement."

ARTH,112,"This course is a chronological and thematic survey of the history of photography from the 1830s to the present mainly in England, France, and the United States. We look carefully at the subject, style, and techniques of representative photos and place them in their social and political contexts. We analyze a range of photographs including early technical experiments, motion studies, popular portraits, avant-garde photos, landscapes, and documentary photography. Some of the issues we discuss include the status of photography as popular art and fine art; photography as a medium of personal and political expression; the relationship of photos to specific historical events; and the histories of women and black photographers. This course is one of a three-semester series in the history and analysis of photography. The courses can be taken independently of each other. No prerequisites."
ARTH,113,"This course surveys the art and architecture of three continents before and after colonization. We consider the role of material products in select examples of cultures from Africa such as Ghana, Nigeria, and Congo; from the high Pre-Columbian civilizations of Mesoamerica; and from North America considering native peoples of the Northeast, Northwest Coast, Plains, and the Southwest. We look at baskets, textiles, ceramics, costume, masks, temples, beads, totem poles, prehistoric rock art, tools, weapons, funerary statuary, and caves and other dwellings, and relate these objects to social practices. The major goal is to situate the arts in their indigenous contexts of time, space, and function, considering their role in ritual celebration; worship; enhancing the hunt, the harvest, and birthing; constructing identity; worshipping ancestors; and maintaining or resisting gender and power relations. We briefly note what these global arts are and have been for the West, in considering the discourse of the ethnographic museum, for example.
The course borrows methods and information from anthropology, geography, literature, and mythology/religious studies, used to deepen an understanding of the art objects. The course also utilizes computer technologies to offer students
images of ancient ruins, for example, and regular access to our library's databases to locate recent scholarly thinking on these topics. Particular attention is given to locations where Simon's Rock offers study abroad trips. This course earns credit toward the Cultural Perspectives or Arts requirement."

Or the multicolored, intricate altars of the mandala (cosmic diagram) in Tibetan monasteries. Or the Ottoman manuscript illumination painted in breath-taking miniaturist detail. Or the foliage of the Japan Zen garden symbolizing the stages of life. Or the painted Indian images of the Hindu god of wisdom Ganesha, elephant-headed and pot-bellied - all these objects offer the opportunity to express religious tenets of Asian peoples. Meanwhile, literati landscape painting, Persian carpets, Japanese woodblock prints, the ceramic vessels of the tea ceremony, the architectural achievements of the Great Wall of China and the Taj Mahal, reputedly an Indian ""monument to love and grief"" dedicated to a wife who died in childbirth, are quasi-secular forms of art. This course surveys the art and architecture of the Middle East and Asia from a variety of historical periods. We consider the role of material products in cultures as diverse as the Maghreb (northwestern coast of Africa) and the Ottoman Empire, China, India, and Japan. We explore the role of artworks as conduits of state ideology and other registers of power, including gender and class. We look at iconography in several media and relate these objects and their motifs to social practices. This course's major goal is to situate the arts in their indigenous contexts of time, space and function. The course borrows methods and information from other disciplines to deepen an understanding of the art objects. The course also utilizes computer technologies to offer students images of ancient ruins, for example, and regular access to our library's databases to locate recent scholarly thinking on these topics. Particular attention is given to locations where Simon's Rock offers study abroad trips. This course fulfills the Writing Intensive requirement OR the Cultural Perspectives OR Arts 	requirement."
ARTH,115,"This course introduces students to twentieth century visual arts, films, and the newly emerging internet culture in China. Students in the course will gain a better understanding of Chinese arts from the perspective of historical, ideological, cultural, and psychological factors. We will also make connections between language, art, and history, though poetry and stories associated with the arts in China. By the end of this course, students are expected to have a better understanding of contemporary Chinese culture and arts. Noprerequistes."
ARTH,116,"Architecture is the art that most impinges on our daily lives, as it creates much of the environment in which we live. This course offers an overview of the foundations of and traditions in Western architecture, thereby giving students a knowledge of and an appreciation for the various aesthetic, religious, political, cultural, social, and symbolic bases for building designs. Beginning with Stonehenge and prehistoric architecture, the class then focuses on some key examples of Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Islamic, Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque architecture. The last third of the semester deals with modern architecture in Europe and the United States, concentrating on the work of figures such as Sullivan, Wright, Gaudi, Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, and Gehry. The course is a combination of lecture and discussion and learning outcomes are evaluated on the basis of class participation, exams (including a final exam), and several short papers."
ARTH,206,"As Britain moved into the modern era, the art of the Victorian era (1837-1901) was deeply ideological, that is, representative of various political agendas at particular moments as the country underwent tremendous social, economic and industrial upheaval.  We study the Pre-Raphaelites, a progressive group of young artists, as well as artists working within the Royal Academy.  Some of the themes in Victorian art steeped in ideology are the roles of women--from ""the angel of the house"" to the fallen woman--childhood, the poor, and workers in city and country including the navvy, the farmer, the sempstress and the governess.  As Queen Victoria built her empire, we consider artistic representations of migration, and British cultural anxiety over the making of colonies and the racialized colonial subject in India, Canada and elsewhere.  Paintings of landscapes, both at home and abroad, suggest new ideologies about nature, the world and Britain's place in each.  Besides painting we explore select examples of sculpture, photography and fashion, all imbued with cultural beliefs, as well as Prince Albert's mammoth undertaking, the Crystal Palace, a self-congratulatory, massive display hall for global and especially British industrial goods.  Throughout the course the work of female artists and of the prodigious art critic John Ruskin are given special attention.  We study writing by theorists such as Michel Foucault and Timothy Mitchell to understand Victorian ideologies about religion, sexuality and colonization."
ARTH,207,"In the past this course has been focused exclusively on western women artists.  Though we retain attention to women in the European and American past, the course has been expanded to consider women artists globally, with special interest on contemporary women artists in Africa, Asia, Central America, and the Middle East.  We consider case studies of women's particular relationships to the processes of social, political, economic and technological change.  We look closely at many examples of women's past and present art in the classroom and discuss them aesthetically and theoretically in order to understand artistic agency and the production of meaning.  We study how women working in a variety of artistic media - painting, sculpture, installation and computer generated arts -- struggle/d to represent their lives, their experiences, their values, and their bodies.  All students present their original research topics to the class.  Students may do additional work to raise the course level and earn 4 credits.  The course is not open to First-Year students except those who have taken Survey 102 or another art history course."
ARTH,209,"This course investigates the phenomenon of Japanese woodblock prints (ukiyo-e), beginning in the 17th century. We analyze their subjects--especially geishas and courtesans--but also actors, wrestlers, and landscapes, and the prints' changing styles and techniques. We read excerpted translations from Edo literature as well as contemporary scholarship in anthropology and history, and we listen to Japanese music in order to understand the prints more fully. We situate them in the context of Japanese society, culture, and politics. No prerequisites."
ARTH,210,"When Edo Japan was opened to traders in the 1850s, woodblock prints were one of several commodities imported into the West. In France and England Impressionist artists used them as a point of departure for their own art making.
After investigating how the prints were imported into the West, we consider their new meanings and associations for avant-garde artists such as Manet, Monet, Degas, Cassatt, and van Gogh, who sometimes quoted from ukiyo-e in their
art and sometimes borrowed their formal or thematic qualities. Emphasis is on the differences between original and borrowed meanings, the appeal of the prints for the middle classes in each country and a range of Western attitudes toward Japanese culture implied by such borrowings. This course satisfies either the Cultural Perspectives requirement or the Arts requirement."
ARTH,211,"This course explores the private and public worlds of Pablo Picasso and presumes that his art cannot be understood without considering both. The course begins with his early work affected by the anarchist movement in Barcelona and ends with his joining the French Communist Party in 1944. Students develop a visual familiarity with the most significant works done by Picasso starting from his youth, continuing through the Rose and Blue Periods, the highly innovative Cubist experiments, the Neoclassical phase, his Dada and Surrealism involvement, and ending with his
monumental Guernica in 1937. Students are offered a method of critically analyzing his paintings, art historical writing on them, and their relationships to political and biographical events in his life: the anarchist movement in Barcelona,
WWI, the Spanish Civil War, Picasso's troubled relationships with several women. We consider how he devises political statements from erotic experience. Conversely, how are his relationships with women formulated by political
and social factors, constituting a ""sexual politics""? How does all this affect the meanings of his art? A major goal is to demythologize Picasso and to locate his progressive art within patriarchal culture. Thus the course interrogates the
connections between Picasso's art, politics, and sexual politics.
No prerequisites."
ARTH,212,"In this course we think about what theory is and what it contributes to our understanding of photography. We read some of the most interesting and influential writing about photography including the work of its classic theorists--Walter Benjamin, Roland Barthes, Susan Sontag--and critical poststructuralists writing today, scholars such as Abigail Solomon-Godeau and Jonathan Crary. We correlate theory to the analyses of specific photographs taken from the last 160 years of photo history. The course is based on the premise that no photograph simply captures reality and instead that all photos, like any other form of cultural representation, are subjective constructions of experience. As such, photos are imbued with conventions and social and political ideologies of the photographer and her/his times. In the second half of the semester, we read critics who have been influenced by the classic theorists and evaluate their case studies of individual photographs and broader issues in the history of photography. This course is one of a three-semester series in the history and analysis of photography; the courses can be taken independently. No prerequisites."
ARTH,213,"The focus of of this course is perhaps the most pervasive element in the American popular cultural landscape: television. Since its inception, commercial network TV has also been considered one of the primary means for inculcating social values and ideologies. The course provides critical, historical, and multi-disciplinary perspectives on viewing network TV as ways to understand, rethink, appreciate, and resist the discourses television offers. It explores how TV contributes to the making of a ""mainstream"" that upholds the status quo, most evident in ""the news"" and commercials. We consider portrayals of gender, race, and sexualities, and we explore the topic of violence on network TV. We consider the value of ""elite"" tools (postmodern, feminist, and queer critical theories) to analyze an accessible and ""popular"" medium. No prerequisites."
ARTH,216,"This course explores the experience, work, and ideas of mostly 20th-century African American artists in the United States. We seek to understand responses of African Americans to those defining moments in our national history: Slavery, Emancipation, World Wars I and II, the Great Depression, the Cold War, the Civil Rights and feminist movements, and our postmodern era. African American thinkers have defined for themselves the great complexity, diversity, and contradiction in documenting these events and responding to them in art produced in the Harlem Renaissance, the Black Power movement, and the present moment in which the problematic politics of multiculturalism plays a role. We foreground the voices of African American artists: painters, sculptors, photographers, and activistwriters (and occasionally musicians). Attention is given to thinkers such as W.E.B. Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, bell hooks, Cornel West, and Henry Louis Gates, Jr. We analyze the politics of anonymous art done by slaves, including quilts; of artists’ assimilation of the influences of Paris and Africa; of folk art, which raises issues of legitimacy and authenticity; and of black mural art. No prerequisites."
ARTH,218,"This course looks at the work of contemporary photographers in the context of the critical discourse that both surrounds and fuels its creation. Among the topics to be discussed are the staged tableau, still-life constructions, appropriation, the body/the self, photography and abstraction, new narratives, reinventing the landscape, and the continual blurring of boundaries between photography and other media. Students in this seminar have the chance to be active critics, writing exhibition and book reviews, and conducting interviews with artists and curators.  We will also use photographs as a springboard for creative writing. Working together the class edits and compiles these writings into an anthology entitledViewfinder. 

With permission from the instructor, students with the prerequisite of Photography (SART 102) may take this class at the 300 level for 4 credits and complete studio work as part of this course. While prior experience in the studio is not necessary, the work of students in the class who are active photographers will serve as a resource for dialogue and critique."
ARTH,219,"During the Renaissance in Italy, a new type of art was developed that quickly became the rage throughout Europe, eventually becoming the standard against which all later Western art was compared.  Later styles either emulated Renaissance art, varied it, or, as Modernism did, rejected it.  The course gives an overview of art in Italy – primarily its painting, sculpture, and architecture – from roughly 1250 (when separate, individual paintings and sculptures start becoming the norm) to about 1540 (the date of Michelangelo’s ""Last Judgment"").  Within these chronological limits, we will examine the work of the most influential artists.  Because Renaissance artists, unlike modern artists, worked almost solely on commission and produced objects that were meant to have a public function in society, the course will also examine the system of patronage that operated during the period.  Regular attention will be paid to artists’ working methods.  No prerequisites."
ARTH,220,"For centuries western observers have been fascinated by the harem, based as it was in slavery and multiple wives.  This course interrogates that cross-cultural fascination, as evidenced in paintings and prints of the harem made mostly in the 19th-century in England and France.  We use poetry, literature, and travel accounts to understand such imagery, including written works by Victor Hugo, Lord Byron, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Florence Nightingale.  We take a backward look at 18th-century writers and artists such as Mary Wollstonecraft, Montesquieu, and even Mozart.  Some early 20th-century texts are also analyzed:  French photographs of North African ""harem women"" c. 1930 and a mini-series titled The Harem  made for television in the 1990s.  The course integrates some theoretical writing by authors such as Edward Said and Homi Bhabha."
ARTH,222,"A focus on clothing in artworks of the modern era opens a new world of inquiry, a fascinating means of entry into culture, society, history, and gender of the last two centuries. This course considers how clothing is represented in specific painted and photographic art of the West. We theorize about why ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" clothing appears in visual art after c.1830 when women become the ""marked"" or decorated gender. In a variety of case studies, we suggest how painted clothing indicated identity, status, and power in various cultures and eras. We trace how images of clothes can be given meanings in their own day and today using current theoretical models. Students choose their own research topics. Prerequisite: Art History 102 or another art history or theory course, or permission of the instructor."
ARTH,224,"This course will explore the artistic, social and political goals of the Harlem Renaissance movement of the 1920s and 1930s. We will read the works of writers and intellectuals and use case studies of the careers of artists based in Harlem and elsewhere to address some of the contextual themes of the movement including New Negro identity, modernism, primitivism, the uses of the folk, the role of the black middle class, patronage and the relationship between cultural politics and the politics of culture. No prerequisite."
ARTH,225,"This course will explore the theory of the performativity of identity and how it can be applied to the critical analysis of works of African American art. Challenging the notion that identity is a fixed state of being, performance theory describes identity as something that is constructed and maintained through the use of repeated gestures, or performances in one¿s daily life. Drawing insight from theoretical texts and the close study of works of art from various genres and media, students will learn to read visual images as enactments of racial, gender, class, religious and regional identity. No prerequisite."
ARTH,226,"This course introduces students to twentieth century visual arts, films and the newly emerging internet culture in China. Students in the course will gain a better understanding of Chinese arts from the perspective of historical, ideological, cultural and psychological factors. We will also make connections between language, art and history, through poetry and stories associated with the arts in China. By the end of this course, students are expected to have a better understanding of twentieth century Chinese culture and arts, making connections to contemporary popular culture on the internet in the recent decades. There are no prerequisites for this course. This course fulfills the arts or CP requirements.

ARTH,227,"Seventy-five years ago on the eve of WWII visual culture flourished at key sites on the globe.  This course reasserts place as well as time as crucial considerations in understanding visual cultures and their overlapping scapes—high art and popular visual culture (advertising, comics, film, and fashion.)  Sometimes the connection between visual culture and war is explicit, as in Hitler’s Great German Art Exhibition (Munich) or anti-Nazi photomontage, posters and caricatures, including the American Superman comic strip.  Sometimes the connection is less obvious, as in the Hollywood film Wizard of Oz, which offered a view into a fantastical time and place that still signals 1939 war concerns.

Other locales and the visual cultural producers to be explored for their relationship to war include Mexico City (Frida Kahlo, Manuel Alvarez Bravo); Paris (Picasso); New York City (Berenice Abbott, Harlem-based Jacob Lawrence); Hawaii (Georgia O’Keefe); Tokyo (anonymous manga).  Sometimes the art-war connection requires hypothesizing, as in the art commissioned by Dole Pineapple, or advertising images of the new nylon stocking, shown at the 1939 New York World’s Fair, an invention that led to a visual fetishization of women’s legs.

No pre-requisites.  First-year students require permission of instructor."
ARTH,306,"Today big tobacco conducts business in nearly every country of the world.  This seminar draws from the disciplines of economics, politics, visual culture, public health and environmental studies.  We follow the dynamics of the industry's expansion of global capital.  The course begins with the 1950s and 60s and the wildly successful domestic marketing of Marlboro, still the world's best-selling cigarette, by its parent company Philip Morris, now named Altria.  We trace PM's use of art and advertising until the 1990s, when it intensified its global focus.  What are the inner workings of this corporation, and why must it expand into new global markets? What are the power dynamics between American corporations like Altria and specific nations abroad, their governments and private companies?  How does PM/Altria use visual culture--art and advertising--in new ways to do business?  What are the public health concerns of exploding rates of tobacco consumption abroad?  What are the effects of these expanded markets on environmental resources?  We also consider how factions abroad profit from, accommodate and resist the opening of foreign tobacco markets on their soil.  The course evaluates global and local efforts to limit big tobacco's influence.  We struggle with the thorny question of how our own scholarly investigation is both a critical intervention and a hegemonic disruption of indigenous self-determination.  In the second half of the semester students choose a nation or geographical area to study in depth, presenting regular reports on their findings and then a final (revised) project. This advanced seminar is open to juniors and seniors; sophomores may enroll only by special permission."

ARTH,309,"In this course we closely read texts by Jacques Lacan, a major contributor to the reformulation of post-Freudian psychoanalysis, a mid 20th-century writer whose influence can be located in almost every discipline of the humanities and social sciences today. Selections from Lacan are read deeply and contextualized within the frameworks of intellectual and political/feminist thought of the last 30 years.
We also watch film and look at visual images, and read theories influenced by Lacan about such texts. We investigate the process of looking as a site at which gender gets constructed. “The gaze” described by Lacan is a concept that registers sexual power relationships, anxieties, and fears. Given a Lacanian spin, visual texts such as painting or photographs take on a richness of interpretation
that offers profound relevance to human experiences of self and other, looking and being seen, desire and lack. Prerequisite: Permission of the instructor."

ARTH,316,"Problems have arisen in every culture about the artist's right to create, to control production, and to choose subject matter. The focus of this course is both historical and contemporary because the timeless concerns of liberty
and creativity are at the heart of the matter. What is the significance of the view that the ""product"" of artistic endeavor is property? Does it make a difference that in the United States this ""interest"" in property is protected through contract and copyright law, while in Europe these ""interests"" are considered both moral and economic? Do music and art pose different legal, philosophical, and creative problems in regard to regulation and to protection of individual rights? Also considered are the problems raised by museums and production rights, the role
of government and corporations in arts funding, and the impact of the law on the individual artist. Works of art, music, and literature that have been the subject of controversy are addressed specifically."

ARTH,100M,"How can abstract art made during revolutionary times convey meaning?  In this module, we use writing to study visual culture that responds to political and social change:  war, social movements, and revolution. Focusing on modern abstract art - including photography - and its relationship to radical change in Europe, the U.S and Mexico, we study the French Realist Courbet; Austrian Symbolist Klimt; Russian Constructivists, German Dadaists Hannah Höch and Schwitters; French Surrealists Magritte and Oppenheim; the ex-patriot Spaniard Picasso; Italian avant-gardists; Harlem Renaissance modernists; Mexican revolutionaries Tina Modotti, Frida Kahlo and Rivera, and American Abstract Expressionists.  Comparing our observations to writing by artists, poets and critics, we consider how language can enrich our experience of art and understanding of political and social change, including how artists’ gendered and ethnic identities affect their politics. In class, students write to prompts, sharing their writing as the basis for discussion. No prerequisites."
ARTH,102M,"This course, the second half of the Western art survey, considers developments in Western Europe from the year 1400 to the present. American art is examined from the 1930s to the present. Lectures and class discussions focus on the changing roles of art and the artist in society; on art as the expression of individual, social, political, and cultural values; on stylistic issues; and on the relationships between art and philosophy, history, and politics (both high politics and cultural politics). Students develop their critical and analytical skills while becoming familiar with a broad selection of works in relation to their cultural contexts. This course is an excellent introduction to art history for students with no previous exposure. No prerequisites."
ARTH,113M,"In the art of several North American native nations we acknowledge their distinct identities, their inter-connectedness, and their liminal relationships to the outsider colonizer.  In this modular course we examine the art of several peoples including Northeast, Southeast, Southwest (including Mesoamerica), West, Northwest Coast, Plains, North (Arctic and sub-Artic), and the Hawaiian Islands.  We consider how cultural beliefs and material needs shape the way the artworks look.  We explore both available natural resources and indigenous attitudes toward nature and the spirit world, as the visual has been crucial in diverse ceremonies from celebration of alliances to war. We investigate how gendered artists of particular nations are expected to work with specific media, including weaving, pottery, beadwork, basketry and painting.  We provide concrete examples of how native nations' art uphold social hierarchies or resist the exertion of power.  This course invites a conceptual continuity between the art of traditional peoples and their contemporary practitioners.  There are no prerequisites for this course."
ARTH,117M,"This course considers the role of art and architecture as material culture produced across the varied geographies of the African continent. We look at baskets, textiles, ceramics, masks, rock art, body art, dance, funerary art, and dwellings, for example, and relate these objects to social practices.  The major goal of the course is to situate the arts in their contexts of time and space and to understand their functions, considering their role in, for example, ritual celebration; worshipping ancestors or gods; making a living, and maintaining or resisting gender and other power relations.  In the contemporary globalized world African artists respond to:  the legacy of colonization, the demand for tourist art, evolving gender constructions, the fragmented micropolitics of the postmodern era, and relations with the West and developed capitalism.  The course borrows methods from anthropology, cultural geography, literature, and religious studies --all used to deepen an understanding of the art objects.  We take a museum trip to see African arts first-hand.  The course provides credit toward either the Cultural Perspectives OR the Arts requirement for the AA.  There are no prerequisites."
ARTH,221M,"In this course students trace the development of Buddhist art in Asia, including sculpture, landscape painting, gardens, calligraphic scrolls, metalwork and architecture. Questions guiding the course and the in-class discussions include:  How and why were the religious principles of Buddhism translated into art forms? How were spiritual concepts still very much imbued with concerns of this world? Did the art actually modify aspects of Buddhist philosophy? While the term “Buddhist art” suggests a coherence across the many art forms and expressions, students are asked to explore how the term refers to a great variety of forms, purposes and meanings across time and place. Fulfills 2 credits toward the CP or Arts requirement.  No prerequisites.

ARTS,105,"Throughout our lives we are called to speak publicly. Sometimes, we are speaking in a group discussion, as in a seminar class or a club meeting. Sometimes, we are asked to make a public presentation, sharing ideas or knowledge with a group of any size. Sometimes, we feel compelled to speak passionately about something that is important to us as in a town hall meeting or a community meeting. Often, in these cases, the fear of speaking publicly overtakes us and we find ourselves communicating incoherently, either because we physically can't make the sound heard (shaky voice, teary voice, breathless voice, too quiet to hear) or because we can't collect our thoughts and communicate in an orderly way. In this course, we will focus on the various tools which can help us all to be more effective communicators. We will focus on the physical tools such as supporting our voices with strong breath, speaking through emotion, establishing and maintaining eye contact, maintaining a strong, comfortable posture, and on the intellectual tools such as organizing our thoughts coherently and communicating them with clarity of diction and specificity of vocabulary. Over the course of the semester, we will present the following: an introductory speech, an impromptu speech, a demonstration speech, an informative speech, and a persuasive speech. The course will demand active participation and will give the participants real tools that they can take into their specific disciplines and use in their professional and personal lives. There is no prerequisite for this course."

Students will also be able to create content using Blender, the premier ""open source"" modeling and animation program, and other programs available in the Arts Computer Lab. Class members, working as individuals and/or in small teams, will explore and create works that combine traditional arts disciplines and media (including performing and studio arts) with human interaction via the computer interface. In addition to becoming familiar with the technical aspects of interactive multimedia, the class will explore the aesthetic and conceptual dimensions with assigned readings and online discussions. Written weekly journals are required of all students. Open to all levels."
ARTS,212,"What is the self and how to describe it? In the postmodern age, the self is said to be nonexistent--elusive at best. Yet the current popularity of memoirs and ""tell-all"" biographies attests to an interest and belief in real selves that can be documented and explained. This course examines works by predominantly 20th-century Western visual artists, photographers, film makers, musicians, choreographers, and writers of drama, poetry, and fiction in order to explore how
artists have attempted to portray either their own identities or those of others. Students will also compose their own works using a variety of art forms to explore how creative expression can capture personality and how each art form offers its own avenue to portraiture.
"
ARTS,225,"This course will explore how Western artists of all genres describe their own creative process and will provide ample opportunities for students in the class to observe their own making of art. Artists' statements and works of art will be the primary texts. A brief overview of the definitions and measurements of creativity in psychology and philosophy will be included as well. Assignments will also include creative projects done in and outside of class in a range of media. Some issues focused on in the readings and experimentation include the degree to which choice, chaos, and intuition enter into art making; personal and social impediments to creativity; sources of inspiration, and creative collaboration. No prerequisites."
ARTS,284,"Taught in conjunction with the Guest Artists Series, Guest Artists invites students into a more intimate relationship with the artists visiting our campus in Spring 2013: Shahzad Ismaily (musician and composer), John Lawson (visual artist and writer) , Ashley Sabin and David Redmon (documentary film makers), and Karen Allen (visual artist, actress and director).  Students will study the work of each artist before they arrive on campus, meeting for a class discussion the week before the campus visit.  When the artists visit campus, students will attend performances and exhibits of their work and have the unique opportunity to engage in a small group conversation with them in order to understand their artistic journey and process.  After each visit, students will process the work they have experienced and engaged with and write a thoughtful response to each artist.  At the end of the course, students will create an artistic response to the work of the semester in the form of a three dimensional project which will come from new ideas, methods of working or inspiration which they received from their contact with the artists."

ASIA,202,"The course examines the most important intellectual, cultural, political, and social events and trends of Japan from prehistory to the present. The approach is multidisciplinary, examining the development of Japanese political institutions, literary arts, religion, and social values, through both primary texts in translation and a range of secondary materials. The focus of the course will be on the development of Japan from an isolated collection of kingdoms to the first Asian imperial power, on to an economic powerhouse and a leader in pop culture around the world. While Japan emphasizes the homogeneity of its people, we will explore the diversity within and the external and internal forces that have shaped its distinctive character."
ASIA,207,"Asian Medical Traditions is intended to provide knowledge of the background and development of key concepts and practices in the history of Galenic/Arabic/Persian, Chinese, and Indian medicine. The materials studied include primary source texts for several of these medical   systems as well as articles that place these medical traditions in a larger context of local biology and culture. Medicine is an especially interesting way to examine biology, societies, and cultures because the theories and practices are interwoven between geographic areas and time periods through the ages. There is great interplay between medical systems in Asia and Europe, dating to the period of Hippocrates. The spread of ideas included knowledge of anatomy, physiology, medicinal botany, midwifery, surgery, and manipulative therapies. We will also examine modern recipients of this rich heritage, Tibetan and Japanese medicine, in order to see how these traditions are transformed and transform the cultures in which they are a part."

Our project is to explore relationships between space and time in narratives on identity dating roughly from the Opium War of the mid-19th century to the era of globalization in the early 21st. Materials for study include scholarly works, political tracts, fiction, essays, documentaries, administrative maps, landscapes, technologies, and more. Our dialogue revolves around the following questions: First, is the concept of the modern nation-state applicable to the People's Republic of China and is the Chinese nation-state strictly a modern phenomenon? Second, how have cultural others--the non-Han peoples--contributed to the idea of ""Zhongguo,"" the ""Central Kingdom(s),"" as opposed to ""waiguo,"" the outside ethno-political entities, through time? What justifications and social controls have been used to facilitate the incorporation of non-Han territories into the Chinese realm and how is this process continuing in the 21st century? Third, how has the concept of socioeconomic class been conceived by modern Chinese political theorists, and upon which varieties of pre-modern social networks and cultural relations were these ideologies cast? How have class-relations developed over the course of the 20th century and into the present day? Fourth, how have gender relations and sexuality served as catalysts for political revolution and social change since the early 20th century? How have they informed Chinese Communist Party policy since 1949 and how are they changing in the post-reform period of economic liberalization and the hollowing out of the state? Fifth, how has space been defined in regard to the nation, the individual, the body, labor, sexuality, gender, ethnicity, the urban, the rural, and national boundaries in a ""globalizing

Issues explored will include, but not be limited to, the construction of gender and sexuality, the process of identity formation, minority relations, the complexity of power relationships, the contested relationship between globalization and localization, and the dangers of ethnocentrism in the Japanese context.  Reading assignments, films, and class discussions will introduce students to major concepts and research methods in social-cultural anthropology while fostering a deeper understanding of contemporary Japan. The broad and interdisciplinary introduction to contemporary Japan provided by this course will be ideal for students seeking a general introduction to Japanese society and culture as well as those seeking a solid background for advanced Japan studies."

Taoism, Mohism, and Legalism. Students learn to debate both historical and contemporary political and social issues through the ideas of these early Chinese thinkers. The second unit focuses on Chinese poetry, primarily the regulated  verse of major Tang Dynasty poets including Wang Wei, Li Bo, Tu Fu, Tao Yuanming, and Tu Mu. Through characterby- character glosses, students learn the principles of reading and writing Chinese poetry. The third unit teaches the fundamental concepts underlying traditional Chinese theater, particularly Kunqu and Beijing Opera. Both visual and oral aspects will be addressed, including a basic introduction to performance techniques. This course assumes no background in Chinese language or culture."
ASIA,237,"If a group of Japanese are asked their religion the most likely response is that they have none.  The reason is that the Japanese consider Shinto and Buddhism as part of their culture, not as a religion in the western context.  While a separation of ""church and state"" is written into the Japanese constitution, in fact such a division does not exist in Japan, today, nor any time in the past.  Buddhism and Shinto totally interpenetrate social, political, economic and cultural life in a way that eludes those who impose a religion category onto Buddhism and Shinto in Japan.  In this course we will examine the unity of Buddhism, and to a lesser extent Shinto, in the political, cultural, social, and economic realms from the 5th century to the present.  Starting before the introduction of Buddhism to Japan we will examine how Buddhist philosophy, power and practices formed and transformed Japanese life.  At the end of the course the student will have a better appreciation of Buddhism and its role in Asian social and cultural development."

ASIA,221M,"How and why were the religious principles of Buddhism translated into visual, material form?  How were spiritual concepts still very much imbued with concerns of this world?  The term “Buddhist art” suggests sameness and coherence, but in reality the term refers to a great variety of forms, purposes and meanings across time and place.   This course traces the development of Buddhist art in Asia from its origins in India in the fifth century BCE and gained adherents when it became the official state religion of Emperor Ashoka in the third century BCE.  Buddhism spread, often along trade routes, into China, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, Nepal, Tibet, Sri Lanka and elsewhere.  Buddhism often blended with other indigenous belief systems, for example, with Hellenistic ideas in Gandhara or Shinto beliefs in Japan to create dynamic syntheses. 

We study Buddhist art made in various materials:   sculptures, landscape painting, gardens, the stupa form, calligraphy scrolls, metalwork, the healing iconographic and sand mandala, and architecture.  Buddhist teaching concepts appearing in art include meditation, karma, sutra, Pure Land practices, enlightenment and nirvana.  The Buddha himself is frequently depicted as the historic Prince Siddharta in scenes from his life, as multiple Buddhas or a colossal Buddha, or in symbolic form, as footprints or the wheel, for example.  The basic iconography of a seated or standing Buddha with distinctive hand mudras, elongated earlobes, half-closed eyes and other distinctive marks, often flanked by bodhisattvas, evolved to reflect cultural needs of a patron in a given era and locale.  From its simple origins Buddhism’s later development grew increasingly complex (ex. Esoteric Buddhism) paralleling the developing notions of statehood throughout Asia.  This too is traced in visual art.

BAS,310,"What, really, does it mean to be infinite?  Is any actually existing thing really infinite?  This course will explore the role that the notion of the infinite plays in such diverse disciplines as philosophy, theology, mathematics, logic, physics, and computer science.  We will examine both the different kinds of problems that arise in the distinct contexts of these disciplines, and how these diverse disciplines have affected and influenced each other with respect to the concept of infinity.  The course will be both historical and topical, as we examine how the concept of ""infinite"" was transformed from originally meaning ""indefinite"", and thus as entailing imperfection, into a concept that entailed transcendent super-excellent perfection; how Aristotle's distinction between potential and actual infinity led to the solution of a number of problems concerning time, space, and motion; how the development of the notion of the infinitesimal in the 17th century led directly to the discovery of the calculus by Newton and Leibniz; and how Georg Cantor's discovery that infinite sets come in different sizes was initially more welcomed by
theologians than by other mathematicians."
BAS,322,"Did God will the world into existence, and must it end with the Second Coming of Christ? Is the class struggle the motor of history, and must the end of history (sometimes Marx called it ""pre-history"") be Communism? Is competition the motor of evolution, making the fiercely competitive civilization of late nineteenth century Europe the benchmark of human development? If we might balk at the assumption that the sole purpose of our parents' lives has been to produce us, what has led us so often, in our theologies, histories, and philosophies, to posit teleological explanations such as the preceding for other human lives and events? It may be, in other words, that there was only chaos ""in the beginning;"" that it heralds no destiny for humanity, divine, natural, or rational; and that the attempt to discover the origins of things is the pursuit of a ""chimera"" (something hoped for, but impossible to achieve).
	In order better to understand our persistent fascination with beginnings and the ends they may (or may not) reveal to us, this course proposes a critical analysis of creation stories we have told ourselves in the west, from the ancient Greeks and Hebrews to the early decades of the twentieth century. We will study venerable tales of the dawn of time, modern tales of founding fathers (or Bands of Brothers, in Freud's case), and meta-narratives of biological, psychological, social, political and cultural development. Included will be texts such as The biblical book of Genesis; Hesiod's Theogony; Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality; Darwin's Origin of Species; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals; Engels' Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State; Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God; Lemaitre's A Homogeneous Universe of Constant Mass and Growing Radius; ""The Declaration of Independence;"" and Freud's Totem and Taboo. These we will read in conjunction with the works of contemporary thinkers (e.g. Michel Foucault, Stephen J. Gould, E. O. Wilson, Julia Kristeva, Donna Haraway, Francis Fukuyama, Gayle Rubin, etc.) who extend and/or critique the positions they take or imply, in an effort to appreciate how these stories of creation can inform our contemporary understandings of the human condition and its prospects.

After a general introduction to the UDHR, we will focus on several of the rights by looking at specific contexts in which these rights have been contested, violated or upheld.  In these case studies we will examine how various artistic modes have represented or advocated for these rights. These modes will include, film, theater, music, visual arts, poetry and prose that employ activist as well as aesthetic strategies. Students will work in groups on a semester-long project that may take the form of a research paper or a substantial work of art accompanied by a detailed artist's statement."

Through close readings of the selected texts, both written and filmed, and through reading and discussion of scholarly writings on the study of narrative, students will develop a deep understanding of the formal strengths of each medium. The comparative study of literature and film provides the opportunity for students to explore for themselves the process of adapting complex prose to the screen. Such works as Howards End, Strangers on a Train, The English Patient, The Sheltering Sky, and No Country for Old Men are discussed."
BAS,383,"Environmental Ethics is the study of the nature and extent of our moral obligations with respect to the environment as well as of the theoretical justification for such obligations.  In this course we shall be especially interested in examining various theories about whether and how various regions of the environment can have an intrinsic moral value, and how such value should affect our attitudes and actions toward our natural environment.  We shall also be concerned with the question of whether and to what extent the ethical questions can be and should be informed by environmental science, as well as with gaining a clear understanding on the limits of science with respect to problems and questions of ethics and morality.  Among the specific topics to be covered are animal rights, and the conflicts that arise between animal rights theories and environmental ethics; various extensionist approaches to the assignment of intrinsic moral value to the environment; deep ecology and ecofeminism as radical alternatives to the extentionist approach to environmental ethics; ethical issues in the restoration and preservation of wilderness areas;  whether and how environmental ethics can be reconciled with demands for social justice; and whether and to what extent religion contributes to or helps to resolve the current environmental crisis.

By the end of the term, we will have examined aspects of pre-Columbian cultural ecology and trade systems; the colonial encounter and the transformation of peoples, landscapes, and sense of place; and a multiplicity of readings surrounding the ideas of ""globalization,"" accommodation, and resistance."
BAS,399,"This course focuses on the ways that human sexuality has been interpreted in the West. Situated at the boundary between the biological and the social, human sexual connection has been feared for its explosive potential to disrupt all other forms of human organization, and interrogated as the key to understanding human nature and individual identity. Sexual behavior has long been the object of religious and state proscription, and concerns about it arguably underlie most methods of state control. Sigmund Freud, the quintessential theorist of modern sexuality, argued that Eros and Thanatos (Love and Death) ruled the world--humans are perpetually caught between elemental drives toward connection and reproduction on the one hand, and the destruction of all life on the other. In Classical Greece, sexual practices were inextricably bound to the education of the male citizen, and love was an aesthetic, spiritual, and corporal experience, which, in Plato's view was crucial to the right and true order of the Polis. While medieval Christians emphasized the association of sex with sin, and insisted on the linkage of true love with the divine, nineteenth century Victorians have been accused of linking humans only by the callous “cash nexus.” Many contemporary scholars (e. g. Michel Foucault) argue that sexuality itself is an historically contingent phenomenon enacting shifting power relationships of all sorts, and question the privileged place it has been accorded in the explanation of human affairs. This course features a close reading of texts (including films, music, art) that have been considered classic expressions of Western understandings of sexuality. Included will be works by authors such as Simone de Beauvoir, the Marquis de Sade, Freud, Foucault, Mozart, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy. On occasion we will have guest faculty to provide perspectives that will enrich our own. This course may be counted as a BA Seminar, or as a core course in the Historical Studies, or Contemporary Critical Theory Concentrations.

DANC,105,"This course explores strategies for movement invention and composition.  Both improvisation, the spontaneous generation of movement that is ephemeral, and choreography, the setting of dances so they can be reconstructed later, will be utilized.  The class will begin with an examination of the formal components of dance -- the body, space, time and energy -- and move on to issues of content.  Throughout, aesthetic issues will be explored, such as: how can movement be discussed and analyzed? How can improvisation and choreography be combined in a finished product? what is personal style and how can it be expanded upon? Readings and watching DVDs will supplement movement homework assignments.  This course is open to any student interested in exploring the formal and expressive potential of dance."
DANC,107,"Moving Issues explores issue-based dance and choreography. The course investigates how personal and cultural issues can be expressed through dance and, in turn, how dance can impact the experience of those issues. Students learn to consider such issues and challenges from an artist's standpoint, through the creation of both improvisational dance and set choreography. The course emphasizes personal expression, the creative process, and the power of the arts to transform our experience of the questions, challenges and concerns faced in our lives. The class includes warm-up exercises, movement and choreography labs, performance opportunities, journaling, discussion, and the use of other arts modalities. Readings and videos deepen the understanding and experience of class material. Response journals, movement assignments and a final project/paper are required."
DANC,108,"The Dance Concert Workshop is a bi-weekly meeting during which student choreographers and performers present dance concert bound works in progress  for constructive and guided feedback from faculty and peers.

DANC,112,"Movement is a powerful means of communication, ranging from literal gesture to the art of the virtuoso. The course explores how this extensive physical vocabulary can be used to express a variety of themes. Each class focuses on an idea and how it can be captured in movement. These themes range from very personal ones, such as autobiography and emotions, to the political, such as war and technology; from the philosophical, such as control and chance, to the aesthetic, such as simplicity and complexity. Improvisation and choreography are the main structures used in class. Homework includes two of the following options: choreography of one work per week on a class theme, a written response to an assigned reading on that theme, or an original response on the theme, which may take the form of creative writing or essay, visual art work, or musical composition. The course is open to students with no prior movement experience (100-level) and to students in dance and theater wishing to continue the exploration of movement as an expressive medium (200-level)."

Issues of concern include stillness and flow, context, point of view, theme and variation, contrast, and balance. Warm-ups; solo, partner, and group improvisations; choreographed studies; and visual art work are the bases for exploration of class themes. The class is open to any interested student."
DANC,206,"Traditionally, theater is thought to be rooted in verbal communication while dance centers on human movement. But since both art forms rely on the live body, they share a number of common formal elements: The body's appearance and action, a presence in space and time, and the use of sound and objects. This course simultaneously presupposes that there is no clear line between theater and dance, AND that each has the potential to be a very different medium of expression. The following two questions are key foci of this class: What are the formal elements available for use in dance and theater? What can be expressed in dance and what in theater? How are they different? The main vehicle for exploring the interplay between the two art forms will be class exercises and improvisations: The experience of doing theater and dance. This will be supplemented with readings, writing, discussion, attendance at performances, watching work on video, and creative assignments done outside of class."

DANC,224,"While today the term 'modern' is used to define many integrated styles of theatrical dance, modern dance at its inception sought complete qualitative distinction, specifically from the romantic ideals of the 19th century. Boundaries among the various burgeoning modern camps were just as absolute and rarely crossed.  As a cultural and intellectual movement in the early 20th century, modernism did not just redefine western artistic creation and performance, but it also played a significant role in reshaping everyday experience. 
This course will consist of an intermediate modern technique/repertory class (choreography developed on students by Marjorie Folkman) followed by academic study and discussion on the development of American modern dance alongside the emergence of modern visual/social culture.

ECON,100,"An introduction to economics as a social science for students with essentially no background in economics, this course provides an overview of the tools that Neoclassical economists use to investigate the behavior of consumers and firms in markets. The course starts with examining consumer choice, production decisions, and income distribution, we then turn to an overview of the economic landscape we have built. Along the way, we seek to examine what is at stake in our choice of economic explanations by discussing various critiques and extensions of basic microeconomic theory. Prerequisites: MATH109, equivalent, placement into MATH210, or permission of instructor.
"
ECON,101,"This course provides a comprehensive introduction to macroeconomics. The course acquaints the student with the prevailing economic theories used by today's policy makers. During the course, we will consider all major economic perspectives, including the central view that markets are a good way to organize the economy, but that markets generate certain significant flaws that need to be fixed. In discussing a number of alternative economic theories and perspectives, the ultimate goal is to increase students' awareness and understanding of economic issues, to improve their ability to evaluate various policy options, and to help them decipher political-economic rhetoric. The course starts with the evolution of societies in human history and the development of modern economic thought. The emphasis is on a conceptual understanding of topics such as economic growth, inflation, unemployment, the role of governments and fiscal and monetary policies. Prerequisites: MATH109, equivalent, placement into MATH210, or permission of instructor.

This course is a basic requirement for the Economics concentration and meets the Economics requirement for the Columbia 3/2 program."
ECON,106,"What is money? Why does it have value, and how is that value affected by the actions of participants in the money system (e.g., the IMF, world central banks, commercial banks, and individuals)? This class provides an introduction to the institutions, operation, and origins of the modern money system and to how economists and others think about that system. It assumes no previous knowledge of economics, though students with prior knowledge of economics will find connections to these fields. The course incorporates primary readings from economists including Young, Bagehot, Hicks, and others, as well as contemporary analysis of the IMF and the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks. No prerequisites, open to first year students."
ECON,107,"This course considers the relationship between economics and technology
from several viewpoints. First, we look at the relationship between
technological change and economic growth, both historically, especially
in the context of the Industrial Revolution, and in a contemporary
setting.  We examine the role that technology plays in economic
development and how different policy choices succeed or fail to transfer
technologies to the developing world. Next, we extend this relationship
to understand the effect that technology has had not only on economies,
but on the discipline of economics itself. Theorists are shaped by their
times, and their theories are as well. We ask how economics has
developed with the economy, and how the future of economics might be
affected by technological changes taking place today.  Finally, we study
intellectual property---the ownership of ideas---and the patent regime,
which codifies and enforces that ownership. We examine critically the
arguments for and against the current intellectual-property system, and
consider possible alternatives.  We study open-source software as an
example of innovation without intellectual property."
ECON,108,"This course introduces students to the field of political economy through Marx's writings in the field the field, along with other political economic theorists of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This course gives students a grounding in Marxist economic discourse and its relation to related social issues, such as race, gender, empire, media, poverty, and the state.  In particular, students will examine questions such as: Is poverty a necessary outcome of industrialization? What are the function and role of the state in industrialization and modern political processes? In addition, students will consider the relationship between economy and empire, as well as the effects of the modern economy on women. No prerequisites."
ECON,109,"In this course, we study the structure and mechanics of financial markets, including the basic language of the stock, fixed-income, and derivatives markets. This expands to a study of the institutions of the financial system, and their interaction with the economy more broadly. The tendency of financial systems to devolve into chaos becomes a jumping-off point for essential questions about the social importance of the financial system, and the question of whether and how to manage it.

Although we begin from the point of view of economics, the goal of the course is to put finance into a multidisciplinary perspective. The central objective of the course is for students to become familiar with the various languages used to talk about finance: those of economists, of market participants, and of the other social sciences (including history, sociology, politics, and psychology). Familiarity with each of these languages is developed through a course focused on primary texts from each of these fields of study."
ECON,200,"Intermediate microeconomics is generally thought of as an extension and continuation of introductory microeconomics.  This course delves more deeply into the tools and the analysis of neoclassical optimization theory.  Specifically, marginal reasoning is taken up with analogy to calculus, and students will derive explicit solutions to optimization problems with  new analytic tools and methods, and further consider and quantify individual rationality as it pertains to optimization problems in the face of scarcity and its welfare implications.  This course also draws on perspectives from Keynesian and Marxist economics, as well as critiques of the relationship between microeconomics and macroeconomics. Specific topics include consumer surplus and choice, cost-minimization and profit maximization, general equilibrium, oligopoly, game theory, economics of information, and welfare considerations.  Prerequisites ECON 100 (Microeconomics) and MATH 210 (Calculus I)  or permission of instructor.  MATH 221 (Multivariate Calculus) recommended."
ECON,204,"This course delves into the tools and the analysis of neoclassical equilibrium theory encountered in the introductory-level course in Microeconomics.  Microeconomics studies the behavior of abstract individuals (for example, human individuals, firms, or nations) relative to prescriptions of self-interest and environment, both independent of other individuals, and codeterminous with other individuals’ behavior.  Specifically, the principle of marginal reasoning is taken up with the application of calculus, with which we derive explicit solutions to optimization problems.  In doing so, we further consider and quantify individual rationality in relation to optimization problems in the face of scarcity as well as welfare.  In tandem, we continue critiquing these tools and understandings, with perspectives from game theoretic, evolutionary, Keynesian, and Marxist perspectives, problematizing the relationship between microeconomics and macroeconomics as we do so.  Specific topics include consumer surplus and choice, cost-minimization and profit maximization, general equilibrium, oligopoly, and economics of information.

ECON,206,"This course presents macroeconomic theory at the intermediate level, exploring its various strands, mainly Keynesian, monetarist, and heterodox. Looking at the United States’ macroeconomic performance, the class examines the fundamental question of whether the capital accumulation process will inevitably lead to sustained economic growth or to a cyclical pattern of boom and bust. Students develop a sound theoretical and empirical understanding, which enables them to think critically about the macroeconomic policy options for the United States economy. Prerequisite: Economics 100 or 101 or permission of the instructor."
ECON,208,"This course explores the tendencies and causes of economic growth in capitalism, with a focus on the role of technology, Students will investigate a variety of ways of understanding technology's relation to economic growth, notable among these being four major paradigms and traditions in economic theory: Neoclassical, Schumpeterian, Endogenous Growth, and Marxian. Examining these theories and various sources of technological change--such as R&D, learning-by-doing, and shifts in human capital--will inform discussions of the political economy of technology within current economic systems, taking a comparative perspective.  The profound social, political and cultural consequences of these dynamics will also be examined. Prerequisites for this course at the 200-level are ECON 101; it is also recommended that students have completed ECON 100. Students who have completed only ECON 100 and at least one additional Social Studies course may take the course with permission of the instructor. For the 300-level, the same prerequisites apply, with the addition of a 200-level course in Economics."
ECON,209,"This course offers an introduction to political economy, including radical economics. Political Economy offers alternatives to the neoclassical view of modern capitalist economies. We start the course by studying the economic theories of Karl Marx such as labor theory of value and surplus and exploitation, and continue with brief introductions of contemporary political economic issues, among which are gender and economics, environment and economics,
globalization and its institutions, political economy of agriculture and food crisis. This course also offers a close look to the theories of an American radical economist, Thorstein Veblen, and his theory of the leisure class. We complete our semester by looking at two alternatives at different scales: First, the Swedish economic system, an alternative to both capitalism and communism, and second, Mondragon Cooperative, a successful co-op in northern Spain. Prerequisites: Economics 100, 101, or permission of the instructor (prior coursework in politics is recommended)."
ECON,210,"In this class, we develop theoretical models of the macroeconomy. We begin with a framework that connects individual action to aggregate outcomes. In this framework, we then study the main theoretical approaches and schools of thought that have dominated research and policymaking in recent decades. Topics covered will include: definitions of the national accounts, recessions and depressions, long-run growth, consumption, unemployment, monetary policy, prices and financial crises. In addition to the work required at the 200-level, students taking this class at the advanced (300) level will determine, in coordination with the professor, a semester-long research project in which they develop a theoretical concept in more depth and/or to make connections between practical and theoretical macroeconomic ideas. They are expected to deliver two 1500-word papers (one at midterm and one at the end of the term) and to lead one 30-minute discussion in class about their project and papers. Students taking the course at the 200-level must have taken a social-science class at the 100-level or above; those taking it at the 300-level must have completed at least one 200-level social sciences class and at least one course in economics.

ECON,214,"This course considers the economic history of the United States, primarily since the colonial period and through the 20th century.  We will consider a variety of topics, including: economic precursors and antecedents for the American colonies; colonial labor markets and immigration; the economics of slavery in the United States (and its relation to the Civil War) and how that continues to fundamentally shape the economic, political, and social contours of the country today; agriculture, transportation, and western expansion; industrialization; the Great Depression; post-WWII global expansion and stability; and, finally, the 1970s ‘stagflation’, ‘neoliberalism’, and the United States' role in the global economy, as a single overarching development.  In doing so we will draw on other disciplines such as sociology and political philosophy.  The overriding goal of the course is for students to engage in critical appraisal of economic theories of US economic development and in doing so to examine broader considerations of industrialization and the United States’ role in the world economy."
ECON,215,"This course provides an overview of some of the issues concerning economic development and underdevelopment. General topics such as growth, modernization, culture, and industrialization, as well as more specific topics such as employment, poverty, inequality, gender, race, and environment will be discussed. To do so, we will refer to major economic paradigms such as Classical Political Economy, New Institutional Economics, Keynesian Economics, and Marxian Political Economy, and to cross-disciplinary approaches such as Post-Developmentalist, Feminist, and Environmentalist. Attempts made by governments, international organizations, pro-development groups and activists to tackle the problem of underdevelopment will be addressed in this course and an effort will be made to connect development theory with development policy and practice.  Prerequisites are ECON 100 or 101 or permission of instructor."
ECON,216,"This course considers the traditional notion of the role of money and banking in the economy, as well as their relationship to other financial assets and to the rest of the economy.  We rely on neoclassical, neo-Keynesian, and monetarist texts, as well as Keynesian and Marxist texts, aspiring toward equal proportion.  Our emphasis is on theoretical considerations.  This aids students in further consideration of macroeconomic and other economic features, as well as broader social concerns, for example relative to government issue of currency and monetary policy, interest rates and profit margins in real and financial sectors, competition within and between real and financial markets, industrialization, income distribution, financial regulation, and everyday life. Prerequisite: one course in Social Studies or permission of instructor."
ECON,224,"Starting in 2007, the world economy entered a severe crisis and deep recession. In this course, we will study the events of the crisis itself, its macroeconomic and financial root causes, and its effects in terms of policy, economic thought, and individual and national welfare. At the intermediate level, the course readings and discussions will remain relevant to students with limited background in economics.
Students taking the course at the advanced level will also be expected to master formal mathematical models describing the circumstances leading to the crisis and approaches to the recovery. 
Prerequisites for the intermediate level course are completion of one 200-level social science class or permission of the instructor; prerequisites for the 300-level version of the class are Introduction to Macroeconomics or permission of the instructor."
ECON,226,"This is a class in the economics of China, focusing on developments since the reforms of 1978. The class will systematically consider key issues in the Chinese economy with the aim of understanding current problems and prospects for the near future. Each topic will be understood in two ways:first through text-based discussion of the particular way it manifests itself in contemporary China, and
second, through the insights of development economics. Topics will include: reforms through the 1990s; growth and poverty reduction; natural resource use; industrial and trade policy; exchange-rate policy; consumption; urbanization and migration; population growth; labor and wages; banks and the financial system; relations with the West. Prerequisites: ECON100 or ECON101."
ECON,227,"This course is a critical engagement with the operation of the global financial and trading system. We consider the meaning and genealogy of theories about the configuration of financial market prices, exchange rates and interest rates. These theories are understood as both descriptive and constitutive of the institutions of the international financial system, including the IMF, the Fed and other central banks, the private banking system, and importers and exporters of goods and services. This body of financial theory and institutional description is the ground for a critical and discussion-based classroom discourse that inquires as to the position and mobilization of the financial system in relation to other social forces.
Prerequisites: Economics 100 or Economics 101."
ECON,240,"We study two great political-economic transitions: first, China's move from early attempts at modernization at the end of the Qing dynasty to the consolidation of Communist power    under Mao and its subsequent inclinations towards state-led capitalism; second, the emergence of Bolshevik Communism following the Russian Revolution and the subsequent developments in the USSR and its successor states. The two historical examples provide an occasion to develop a comparative method for the study of the institutions of political economy, and the underlying tensions between economy and politics; stasis and change; and theory and practice. In this comparative frame, we study the material, ideological, and aesthetic dimensions of political economy. The class develops essential themes for students of economics and politics, but students are also encouraged to integrate their work from other disciplinary perspectives (literary, aesthetic, quantitative). Prerequisite: any 200-level course in the Social Studies Division, or permission of the instructor.
"
ECON,250,"This year, this topics course will focus on the history of money and banking in modern economies, from their inception in bills-of-exchange markets in 13th century France to electronic networks of the internet. We study the introduction of money into commodity exchange, the innovation of financial instruments and their boom and bust cycles, the relation between financial crisis and the real economy, the broader economic cycles of empires and nation states, and the origin and role of central banking and vehicle currencies. An important component of the course is the formation of monetary policy briefs, and in preparation we read articles in the financial press and monetary policy briefs from the Fed. Students can contribute their policy briefs to the Boston Fed Challenge, a competition of undergraduate teams. This course offers an introduction to the macroeconomic and monetary orientation of the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College. Prerequisites: Principles of Economics, or a course in History, or a course in Geography, or permission of the instructor."
ECON,304,"This course is an introduction to political economy at an advanced level. Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, Karl Marx's Capital and John Maynard Keynes's General Theory serve as the principal texts, along with contextualizing histories. Each economist is read in three ways: First, as an attempt by each thinker to make sense of the problems of his own time; second, as a contemporaneous example
of economic theorizing; and third, as a contemporary example of economic theorizing. From these foundational works, the essential questions and concepts of political economy are developed."
ECON,305,"We study situations that modern economics ignores--black markets, gift economies, household and non-state (anarchist) production. We recover an economics that attends to the interplay between agency and authority in such situations. We organize these phenomena along three margins. The first is between economy and law, starting with black markets--proscribed goods and services. This leads to organ markets, human trafficking, slavery; in theoretical terms, the distinction between labor and capital. Our focus then shifts to the margin between market and non-market: on the one hand non-market collective productive phenomena such as the open-source operating system Linux and similar projects, analyzed as gift economies; on the other non-market production in the household and in prisons. The third margin is between economy and state; we study modern non-state economic phenomena (bitcoin, DAO) alongside anthropological research on societies that have intentionally evaded the state. Prerequisites: Students must be sophomores or above and have taken at least one social studies course at the 200 level or above.
"
ECON,306,"This course presents macroeconomic theory at the intermediate level, exploring its various strands, mainly Keynesian, monetarist, and heterodox. Looking at the United States’ macroeconomic performance, the class examines the fundamental question of whether the capital accumulation process will inevitably lead to sustained economic growth or to a cyclical pattern of boom and bust. Students develop a sound theoretical and empirical understanding, which enables them to think critically about the macroeconomic policy options for the United States economy. Prerequisite: Economics 100 or 101, and Calculus I, or permission of the instructor."
ECON,308,"This course explores the tendencies and causes of economic growth in capitalism, with a focus on the role of technology, Students will investigate a variety of ways of understanding technology's relation to economic growth, notable among these being four major paradigms and traditions in economic theory: Neoclassical, Schumpeterian, Endogenous Growth, and Marxian. Examining these theories and various sources of technological change--such as R&D, learning-by-doing, and shifts in human capital--will inform discussions of the political economy of technology within current economic systems, taking a comparative perspective.  The profound social, political and cultural consequences of these dynamics will also be examined. Prerequisites for this course at the 200-level are ECON 101; it is also recommended that students have completed ECON 100. Students who have completed only ECON 100 and at least one additional Social Studies course may take the course with permission of the instructor. For the 300-level, the same prerequisites apply, with the addition of a 200-level course in Economics."
ECON,310,"In this class, we develop theoretical models of the macroeconomy. We begin with a framework that connects individual action to aggregate outcomes. In this framework, we then study the main theoretical approaches and schools of thought that have dominated research and policymaking in recent decades. Topics covered will include: definitions of the national accounts, recessions and depressions, long-run growth, consumption, unemployment, monetary policy, prices and financial crises. In addition to the work required at the 200-level, students taking this class at the advanced (300) level will determine, in coordination with the professor, a semester-long research project in which they develop a theoretical concept in more depth and/or to make connections between practical and theoretical macroeconomic ideas. They are expected to deliver two 1500-word papers (one at midterm and one at the end of the term) and to lead one 30-minute discussion in class about their project and papers. Students taking the course at the 200-level must have taken a social-science class at the 100-level or above; those taking it at the 300-level must have completed at least one 200-level social sciences class and at least one course in economics. The class is mathematical in nature but prior exposure to calculus is not required.

ECON,325,"Deleuze is arguably among the most important social theorists of the second-half of the twentieth century.  His theories explore how economic organizations pertain to psychic organization in 20th century industrial societies. His theory of the rhizome pertains to the nodal and networked extension of repeated actions across individuals in capitalist modernity, due to the nodal and networked aspect of production. Planarity pertains both to the transmission of repeated action across associates (contrasted to hierarchical transmission) and the sameness of the behaviors undertaken by social actors, ironically concomitant with their psychic and behavioral fracture.  This course involves the close reading of Difference and Repetition, Capitalism and Schizophrenia: Anti-Oedipus, and A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia.  Prerequisites: one 200-level Social Studies course or permission of the instructor."

ECON,327,"This course examines current issues and theories of the cross-border flows of goods and money. We place special emphasis on understanding the role of the IMF, the Fed and other central banks, the private banking system, and importers and exporters. Financial markets, exchange rates, and interest rates serve as key loci for the effects of such flows. The configuration of international economic flows serves as the basis for consideration of financial crises and current policy debates.
Connections can be made to regional issues (China, oil-exporting regions, resource-rich countries, etc.) or other broad questions, as dictated by the students' interests. Prerequisites: Economics 100 or Economics 101, and one 200-level economics course."
ECON,328,"Algorithmic trading or statistical arbitrage is automated trading on an electronic network.  Considering algorithms simplifies human behavior in a known context and considering their relation to market structure in the context of profitability may provide an inroad into considering complex market dynamics more generally. This course gives students a hands-on experimental practicum in the emergent interdisciplinary field of algorithmic trading that concerns disequilibrium economic phenomenon. Additionally, the course provides students with theoretical and computational tools for use across a wide range of economics and computer science fields, and gives them practice engaging potentially publishable pseudo-experiments and presenting them to their peers. This course is appropriate for (1) students in economics who are interested in the forefront of research on disequilibrium economics, as pioneered by financial practitioners, (2) computer science students interested in agent-based modeling, complexity science, and statistical search, and (3) students in the natural and social sciences interested in theoretical and applied cellular automata in complex and indeterminate environments. Prerequisite: One course in economics along with Introduction to Statistics (Mathematics 110) and/or Computer Science I (Computer Science 100), equivalent, or instructor’s permission"
ECON,330,"This course is a critical approach to classic political-economic relationships between present and future: entrepreneurship, central planning, investment, and speculation. Each of these relationships proposes a dependence of future material conditions, social relationships, production configurations and financial obligations on present conditions, thought, decision and action. Different modes of anticipating the future (expectation, imagination, and dream) entail different interactions between perception, understanding, emotion, and rationality. The tension between the expansive creativity of the dream and the constrained finality of debt serves as a starting point for understanding neoliberal financial capitalism and its relationship to time. We use sources from economics, psychology, and social theory to reconstruct an economic understanding of how today’s actions determine tomorrow’s conditions. Prerequisites: a previous 200-level course in the social studies, or permission of the instructor.
"
ECON,340,"In this class, we study in comparative perspective two of the greatest economic transitions in recent history: first, the shift of China's economy from being mostly state-led to being mostly market-led; second, the emergence of the countries of Eastern Europe as independent states after the fall of the Soviet Union. Each of these transitions has evolved profound political and social change as cause and consequence of shifts in the predominant underlying economic organization and relationships. Unifying themes for the course include the tensions between economics and politics, between change and stability, and between theory and practice. We focus in particular on the pragmatic questions of implementing and financing industrialization and economic openness. The course is cross-listed in economics and politics at the 200 level, with an optional extra paper and presentation at the 300 level.  Prerequisite: an economics or politics course at the 200 level."

process of politics, of human organization, than of ecology,” and that “although
ecological perspectives are vital, nature protection is a complex social
enterprise…it is the sociopolitical realm that enhances or diminishes conservation
efforts.” This course examines the sociopolitical realm in terms of its metaphors of
nature, its conservation practices, and the specific biogeographies and regional
ecologies in which it seeks to define its moorings. We focus on the historical
origins and current implications of concepts and practices involving nature,
wilderness, conservation, preservation, and biodiversity. Case studies drawn from
all biomes and world regions examine the social, cultural, political, and ecological
dimensions of nature conservation and protected area management in relation to
processes of globalization and increasing concerns for environmental justice and
sustainable development. We analyze the ways in which protected areas and
other conservation schemes articulate with rural subsistence and commercial land-use patterns, indigenous knowledge systems, local resource management
practices, landscape ecologies, eco- and ethno-tourism, and the making of
environmental subjects. The course includes several field trips, a practicum on

Students will be asked to consider how women's writing is defined and how this definition evolved. The course will focus on two main themes: What women do with and for authorship, and how far the designation of ""female writer"" can be stretched. Do women writers employ ""female writing"" exclusively? Can male authors act as ""female writers""? The historical and cultural context of each work will be considered. The course will include texts from such authors as Christine de Pisan, Pernette du Guillet, Labé, Lafayette, Sévigné, Staël, Sand, Mariama Bâ, Beauvoir, Duras, Cixous, Scudéry, and Wittig. Prerequisites: French 206 or higher."

FREN,210M,"The aim of this course is to improve students' reading comprehension, speaking skills, vocabulary, and writing in French through the reading of major French and African Francophone newspapers.  Each week, students will examine a topical event in class as reported by major French and African Francophone newspapers such as Le Monde, Liberation, Le Nouvel Observateur, Jeune Afrique, etc.  A wide variety of subjects will be covered including science, sport, politics, arts and literature.  For each class day, students will write a summary of the assigned newspaper report in French in his/her own words; this summary will undergo peer review and will be graded. A class discussion will follow in which the students will assess how each newspaper treated the information, which aspects it emphasized or ignored, and how the information was presented in terms of style and vocabulary.  Student presentations (one per student) will provide background information on the assigned topic.  A final paper and a weekly vocabulary list will also be required.  This course is conducted entirely in French.  Prerequisite: FREN 205 or equivalent or permission of instructor.

FS,100,"All first-year students are required to take the two-semester First-Year Seminar.  This course interrogates the origins of Western civilization by exploring a wide variety of primary sources from the Mesopotamian, Greco-Roman, Judeo-Christian, and Islamic cultures, within the Levant, Mediterranean Basin, and Europe.  Drawn from antiquity through the 15th century, the course materials encompass a wide variety of media, including written texts; architectural structures, sculptures, paintings, and other visual representations; musical selections; and recited sacred and secular texts.  Writing-intensive in nature, this course encourages students to examine, articulate and support their responses to and ideas drawn from the assigned sources.  The main learning goals for this course are developing critical reading skills, including the ""reading"" of non-textual materials, and expressing ideas gained from such reading in oral and written forms.

FS,101,"This course centers on changes in the nature of knowledge and knowing, as various revolutions--the Scientific Revolution, political revolutions (American, French, and others), and the Industrial Revolution--swept the world. Initially centered in Europe, the geographic range of this course expands into the New World as the notion of Western civilization changes with the colonization of the Western Hemisphere. Drawn from the 16th century through the year 1850, course materials present the theories of the era and their manifestations in a wide range of forms, including poetry, drama, autobiography, and the novel; sacred hymns and secular opera; and paintings, photographs, and other forms of visual expression. Students also investigate critical secondary articles in conjunction with the primary sources. Building upon First-Year Seminar I, students in this writing-intensive course work to raise their skills of critical reading, thinking, writing, and discussion to greater levels of complexity and sophistication."

GEOG,100,"This is a standard course in physical geography with an additional focus on the history of human ecological adaptation. Students gain essential knowledge of the interrelationships between earth’s climate system (climatology), weather (meteorology), life systems (biogeography), and landforms (geomorphology), and how humans have adapted to and affected the earth’s biomes beginning in the late Paleolithic and continuing into the present. There is a strong emphasis on map reading and interpretation of geographical data and the course includes several field exercises. During the latter part of the semester we address questions including the following: How did hunter-gatherers adapt to Pleistocene glaciations and interglacial periods? How did Neolithic societies develop horticulture and how did this lead to agriculture? What are the major forms of agriculture and why does this still matter in the age of fossil fuels and agribusiness? On what ecological bases and with what impacts did the earliest socially stratified, urban-centered, tax-levying, resource-appropriating, militarist polities emerge and endure or fail?"
GEOG,114,"Cultural geography is the interdisciplinary study of spatial practices through which individuals and socio-cultural groups create meaningful environments and ascribe order to landscapes, nature, and the terrestrial realm as a whole.  Drawing from the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, the discipline examines the ways in which humans experience, define, delimit, and shape spaces and places through time. This course is a ""hands on"" introduction to major themes of cultural geography, with regular project work and several field trips (on campus and in the Berkshire region), which focus on a variety or wild, agricultural, smalll town, and urban landscapes. The course focuses on participant observation, the use of archives and literary sources, multimedia, map interpretation and intepretive cartography. A premium is placed on creative means of conveying the human experience of space and place. Themes covered in the course include space, place, and power; property and public/private space; psychoanalytics of the body, space, and territory; national identity and cultural landscapes; the spatialization of race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality; critical perspectives on urban and regional development and planning; and geographies of globalization and empire.

GEOG,205,"A well-known conservation theorist has noted that “Nature protection is more a
process of politics, of human organization, than of ecology,” and that “although
ecological perspectives are vital, nature protection is a complex social
enterprise…it is the sociopolitical realm that enhances or diminishes conservation
efforts.” This course examines the sociopolitical realm in terms of its metaphors of
nature, its conservation practices, and the specific biogeographies and regional
ecologies in which it seeks to define its moorings. We focus on the historical
origins and current implications of concepts and practices involving nature,
wilderness, conservation, preservation, and biodiversity. Case studies drawn from
all biomes and world regions examine the social, cultural, political, and ecological
dimensions of nature conservation and protected area management in relation to
processes of globalization and increasing concerns for environmental justice and
sustainable development. We analyze the ways in which protected areas and
other conservation schemes articulate with rural subsistence and commercial land-use patterns, indigenous knowledge systems, local resource management
practices, landscape ecologies, eco- and ethno-tourism, and the making of
environmental subjects. The course includes several field trips, a practicum on
trail building and maintenance, and an introduction to landscape
interpretation. One class each week is devoted to work on the Simon’s Rock
Interpretive Trail. No prerequisites."

Case studies explore contested terrains where industrialization, commoditization, and capitalism collide and articulate with rural, preindustrial modes of resource management and indigenous systems of environmental knowledge and innovation.  Given the diversity of reconfigurations, resistances, and co-productions arising in conjunction with resource imperialism and hegemonic environmental governance, we cannot settle comfortably within a narrative of cascading cultural and ecological extinctions; through the study of competing environmental ontologies, epistemologies, cosmologies, and practices, we consider a range of alternative visions of ""development,"" ""urban-rural,"" ""core-periphery,"" ""stewardship,"" ""sustainability,"" ""modernity,"" ""globalization,"" and ""nationhood."""

GEOG,215,"Crop cultivation and the rearing of animals to produce food, drink, fiber, feed, fuel, and medicine have been humankind's primary enterprises through most of history.  Today, agriculture remains one of the most important economic activities, occupying over one-third of the world’s laboring population and covering the greater part of the earth's land surface.  Since the earliest plant and animal domestication in prehistoric (Neolithic) times, a diverse array of cropping and herding systems has altered terrestrial biomes on a grand scale, and most of the world’s cultural landscapes are agricultural.  While we all depend upon the food surpluses generated by farms, ranches, and feedlots for daily sustenance, there is tremendous geographic variation in the political, economic, and cultural significance of agriculture in daily life.  In urban-industrial societies such as the United States, less than two percent of the population is engaged in agriculture, while in many parts of Asia and Africa, over 70 percent of the population consists of farmers and herders.  This course examines the ecological and social history of agriculture, focusing on prehistoric plant and animal domestication; the importance of grain production and surplus in the development of socially stratified state-based civilizations; the role of agrarian labor and landscapes in state-peasant and state--non-state dynamics; the relationship between the European enclosures and the global spread of capitalism and colonialism; and the political and ecological impacts of the diffusion of agricultural technologies, techniques, and products worldwide.  After comparing how traditional and modern agricultural practices have shaped landscapes, ecosystems, and polities through time, we analyze current issues of agricultural production, including the dominance of agribusiness, bioengineering, fossil fuel dependence, new definitions of socio-ecological sustainability (including organic farming, community-supported agriculture, and permaculture), and the relationships between agriculture, sense of place, and subjectivity.  This course provides opportunities for work on the Simon’s Rock Community Garden and includes field trips to local farms in the Berkshires and to farms operated by Simon’s Rock alumni in Vermont."
GEOG,225,"This course examines the making of Chinese modernity through the construction and contestation of spaces delineating class, gender, ethnicity, and nationhood. Our project is to explore relationships between space and time in narratives on identity dating roughly from the Opium War of the mid-19th century to the era of globalization in the early 21st. Materials for study include scholarly works, political tracts, fiction, essays, documentaries, administrative maps, landscapes, technologies, and more. Our dialogue revolves around the following questions: First, is the concept of the modern nation-state applicable to the People's Republic of China and is the Chinese nation-state strictly a modern phenomenon? Second, how have cultural others--the non-Han peoples--contributed to the idea of ""Zhongguo,"" the ""Central Kingdom(s),"" as opposed to ""waiguo,"" the outside ethno-political entities, through time? What justifications and social controls have been used to facilitate the incorporation of non-Han territories into the Chinese realm and how is this process continuing in the 21st century? Third, how has the concept of socioeconomic class been conceived by modern Chinese political theorists, and upon which varieties of pre-modern social networks and cultural relations were these ideologies cast? How have class-relations developed over the course of the 20th century and into the present day? Fourth, how have gender relations and sexuality served as catalysts for political revolution and social change since the early 20th century? How have they informed Chinese Communist Party policy since 1949 and how are they changing in the post-reform period of economic liberalization and the hollowing out of the state? Fifth, how has space been defined in regard to the nation, the individual, the body, labor, sexuality, gender, ethnicity, the urban, the rural, and national boundaries in a ""globalizing

GEOG,226,"This course explores the nexus between place, community, and forces of global production.  With texts, documentary, and live places as our media, we examine the ways in which local community interactions are actively linked to conceptions of culture, the environment, ecology, hazards, and economic development.  Case studies of communities from around the world provide a spectrum across which to gauge the similarities and differences in the ways that global economic, political, and social forces produce, marginalize, or annihilate places and communities, and how local people and international networks maintain active participation.  Assessing neo-liberal, socialist, environmentalist, feminist, and other paradigms for community development, we gain critical perspectives on the roles of NGO's (non-governmental organizations), TSM's (transnational social movements), TAN's (transnational action networks), and other links in a shifting network of global, local, and regional power.  Beyond the classroom we engage in local community service in cooperation with organizations such as Habitat for Humanity and Manos Unidas, thus strengthening the relationship between our college and people who reside in the Berkshires.  Guest speakers will provide additional first-hand experience on the challenges of community activism and the multidisciplinary and critical philosophy underlying ecologically and socially sustainable development."
GEOG,227,"This course will focus on the creation of a sustainable forest garden for Simon's Rock.  Students will learn the basics of landscape design, review existing design plans, select elements of those plans to develop a master plan for the garden area (which will include a detailed implementation timeline), and begin the process of forest garden construction.  Garden work will teach the skills of habitat observation and analysis, soil testing, community mapping, and food and plant cultivation. While doing the physical work of garden creation, we will also explore the food system on campus and develop ways of making it more sustainable, focusing on native plant communities of Berkshire County and the best ways to incorporate certain non-natives into an ecologically and socially sustainable forest garden.  Students will work together to develop a meaningful definition of sustainable food production at Simon's Rock in light of the core values and practices of permaculture - earth care, people care, and fair share.  We will also explore how the Simon's Rock Community Garden, as an emerging permaculture site, relates to the larger community."
GEOG,228,"Data science is quickly becoming a necessary skill for a variety of academic disciplines and careers.  Geographic data, broadly defined as any dataset that contains location details of some kind, is particularly fascinating because it allows for analysis based not only on its contents but its spatial context.  This course will focus on providing students with the tools necessary to identify geographic data, understand how it is created and used in the real world, and manipulate it to perform analyses of their own.  It will focus on modern tools and techniques while providing a historical background in the relatively new field of geographic information systems with the goal of turning students into active, literate, and critical users of geographic data.  Topics will include understanding how GPS works for both consumer devices and scientific tools, what’s going on in the back end of the web maps and interactive geographic visualizations now common in popular media, how to access public data sources to learn about the landscape the college inhabits, how to create their own interactive web-based maps, and more.  The course will take advantage of the fact that modern students are intimately familiar with the internet, and readings and assignments will have students doing real-world tasks like searching open-source software documentation and requesting current data from public agencies.  It will include an introduction into industry-standard software including ESRI ArcGIS and open-source alternatives and a module on cartographic design, but the emphasis of the course is on providing geodata literacy in general rather than focusing on technical instruction for one software platform."
GEOG,229,"This course is an immersion in classic works on space and place, addressing how they are socially constructed and why that matters.

In addition to analyzing the location of these classics within paradigms, schools, and networks of intellectual influence, students apply the ideas most tenable for (even if contradictory to) their own new or ongoing work on projects of their own design.  Seminal topics include the production of space; spatial justice; the body, power, and discipline; recurring conceptions of the urban and the rural; the architecture of the imagination; and ""in-between"" spaces that are, as Bhabha posits, ""produced in the articulation of cultural difference.""

GEOG,330,"The English word, territory is probably derived from the Latin territorium – land around a town, domain, or district – but does territorium itself come from terra (earth, land) and –orium (a suffix denoting place), or was it derived from “terrere” (to frighten), indicating a place or area from which outsiders are driven or repelled by fear.  Linguists may fight over the origins of territory, but all humans continue to inhabit a world in which the territorial precedes the terrestrial in the ordering of everyday life and the common play of power.  This course focuses upon the powers and rituals that animate agon, the contests and struggles for victory over territory, and victus, the multiform practices of living, providing, sustaining, conquering, subduing, and being subdued.  Following the linkages between institutional constructions of imagined communities, national boundaries, and individuals willing to fight and die for them, we explore the spatiality of territorial conflict known as war.   By foregrounding spatial perspectives in social theory and readily crossing disciplinary borders, we consider heroism, masculinity, aggression, the “nature” of violence, wars and frontiers, the clash of civilizations, “wars on terror,” and the ties that bind us to markets and techno-industrial production systems that raise specters of warfare as inevitable competition for nonrenewable resources and combat as a game for warrior-androids.

In urban-industrial societies such as the United States, less than two percent of the population is engaged in agriculture, while in many parts of Asia and Africa, over 70 percent of the population consists of farmers and herders.  This course examines the ecological and social history of agriculture, focusing on prehistoric plant and animal domestication; the importance of grain production and surplus in the development of socially stratified state-based civilizations; the role of agrarian labor and landscapes in state-peasant and state--non-state dynamics; the relationship between the European enclosures and the global spread of capitalism and colonialism; and the political and ecological impacts of the diffusion of agricultural technologies, techniques, and products worldwide.  After comparing how traditional and modern agricultural practices have shaped landscapes, ecosystems, and polities through time, we analyze current issues of agricultural production, including the dominance of agribusiness, bioengineering, fossil fuel dependence, new definitions of socio-ecological sustainability (including organic farming, community-supported agriculture, and permaculture), and the relationships between agriculture, sense of place, and subjectivity.  This course provides opportunities for work on the Simon’s Rock Community Garden and includes field trips to local farms in the Berkshires and to farms operated by Simon’s Rock alumni in Vermont."
GEOG,231M,"This course introduces students to the study of long-term human impacts on the
earth’s biosphere and atmosphere, as well as current research on predicted
climate change scenarios and their likely effects on regional weather patterns,
ecosystems, and human societies. An introduction to climatology and
biogeography enables critical evaluation of long-term effects of human activities
on earth systems. The use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and other
digital media, allows students to create and explore models of the past, present,
and future of human-environment relations in specific locales, regions, and
nations. Topics include: changing temperature and precipitation regimes, global
sea-level rise, ecological disturbance in specific biomes and ecosystems, land use
change, shifting economic and political patterns, migration, displacement,
urbanization, and land use. GIS exercises enable students to gain hands-on
familiarity with these subjects and the ecological politics that surround them
given the limits of our ability to model an uncertain future."
GEOG,330M,"The English word, territory is probably derived from the Latin territorium – land around a town, domain, or district – but does territorium itself come from terra (earth, land) and –orium (a suffix denoting place), or was it derived from “terrere” (to frighten), indicating a place or area from which outsiders are driven or repelled by fear.  Linguists may fight over the origins of territory, but all humans continue to inhabit a world in which the territorial precedes the terrestrial in the ordering of everyday life and the common play of power.  This course focuses upon the powers and rituals that animate agon, the contests and struggles for victory over territory, and victus, the multiform practices of living, providing, sustaining, conquering, subduing, and being subdued.  Following the linkages between institutional constructions of imagined communities, national boundaries, and individuals willing to fight and die for them, we explore the spatiality of territorial conflict known as war.   By foregrounding spatial perspectives in social theory and readily crossing disciplinary borders, we consider heroism, masculinity, aggression, the “nature” of violence, wars and frontiers, the clash of civilizations, “wars on terror,” and the ties that bind us to markets and techno-industrial production systems that raise specters of warfare as inevitable competition for nonrenewable resources and combat as a game for warrior-androids.   Is there an end in sight, or will humans decide that a world without a cause for which to die is no world in which to live?

GS,101,"Gender is a complex and contested aspect of human life. This introductory course will explore individual and societal assumptions about how gender identity is produced by the intersection of cultural norms, individual experience, nature, nurture, desire and power. We will analyze gender relations and identities in terms of biological imperatives, women's and men's choices, the social construction of masculinities and femininities, as well as laws, institutions and the distribution of power and resources in any given society. How do variables of nationality, ethnicity, 'race,' class and sexual orientation modify individuals' experience of their own gender, and social classifications of various individuals?  How are do the socially constructed roles of masculinity and femininity enable or constrain individuals?  What role do queer folk play in stretching the boundaries of these roles, and to what extent do they reproduce heterosexual norms? Drawing on essays, film, and three books about the construction and implications of gender in the U.S., we will incorporate analyses from the discourses of science, social science, cultural studies, feminist, and queer theory to identify where binary gender comes from, what in our culture promotes it, and why we're so attached to these often limiting categories. Requirements include regular response journals, two papers, an oral report and a final exam."
GS,210,"Gendered violence is epidemic in our society, even in peacetime, but it often goes unrecognized as such. When school shootings occur, for example, they are always committed by young men, but the gender of the assailants is generally passed over by the press. Where violence is concerned, women are more often the victims, men more often the actors: almost all sexual assault is committed by men, and young men and boys are also more likely than young women to play violent video and computer games and to be attracted to violent movies and pornography.  They are also more likely than girls to use violence self-destructively, through suicide. Why?  Can we blame it all on testosterone, as a ""natural,"" biological phenomenon that won't go away no matter what we do?  Or is the violent tendency of boys learned behavior that can be unlearned, or at least not taught to successive generations?  What would have to change in our social relations in order for young men to grow up less attracted to (and consumed by) violence? Through film, novels, essays and guest lectures, this class will explore the effects of violence on both genders, focusing particularly on rape, sexual assault, sex trafficking and pornography and looking for solutions to the global epidemic of violence.  Requirements will include weekly response journals to the reading, and an independent research project with an accompanying class presentation."
GS,211,"This class will focus on the ways in which masculinity is linked with violence in military culture, in the media, in military academies and boot camp, and in the armed forces.  We will explore how women have fit into this culture as they have slowly but steadily increased their representation in the military, and what tensions have arisen as a result of their presence. We will look at the effects of war on the combatants as well as on civilian populations that come under fire, focusing particularly on the Bosnian conflict, the Iraq war and the on-going civil wars in Africa. Readings will include Evan Wright, Generation Kill, Chris Hedges, War is Force That Gives Us Meaning, and Emmanuel Dongala, Johnny Mad Dog as well as many shorter excerpts and essays.

HIST,101,"Can one person ""change the course of history,"" or are we all merely characters in a grand historical script authored by forces beyond our control? What is more important to learn about the past: the ways that people made love, or the ways that they fought wars? What might future historians conclude about America from this modern day newspaper headline: ""Wall Street buoyed by increased rate of joblessness"" (The Berkshire Eagle, 6/3/00)? Voltaire's irreverent definition of history as ""the tricks we play on the dead"" calls attention to the ways that we, not people in the past, make history, writing their stories to suit our current needs. Our task, then, is to produce a history that informs our understanding of the present while doing justice to the lives of our forebears. This course begins with a brief outline of human experiences from the Paleolithic era to the early 21st century, which is then questioned and elaborated through consideration of a series of issues important for the study of World History on a macro and micro level (e.g., gender relations and sexuality, industrialization, peaceful and hostile
cross-cultural encounters, etc.). Students weigh evidence, enter into debates with scholars, and write several pieces of original historical analysis. In their study of specific problems, students also consider the ""big questions"" that historical investigation can illuminate: Does human nature change over time? How can human action effect change? How can we appreciate rather than fear the differing ways humans cope with the challenges of their day? Where do we turn for practical knowledge and ethical grounding in our own era when it seems that rapid obsolescence is the only sure thing?"
HIST,110,"This course introduces history as an academic mode of inquiry by exploring a set of questions. What is time, and how do we explain change, and maybe continuity, in human (and perhaps non-human) existence over time? What can we really know about an ultimately irretrievable past, how do we know it, and why? What is the relationship between the past, as we scrutinize and reconstruct it from the perspective of the present, and life today, as well as, perhaps, life in the future? Is it possible to find meaning for ourselves, and perhaps discover our identities, in the past, and if so, how? Are their particular scales of space and time that are best suited for history, and if so, what are they? Is history a humanistic enterprise, meant to be narrated as stories, or a scientific way to test ideas from philosophy, the social sciences, and other disciplines according to temporal variables? We will ask these and other questions that have long haunted historians by reading, discussing, and writing about history, historical thought, and historical methods through the work of authors ranging from E.H. Carr, David Armitage, and Jo Guldi to Richard Evans and Hayden White. We will also read and examine academic histories and learn how historians “make” history by critically reading scholarship as well as original historical sources ranging from textual documents, oral histories to art and documentaries on a variety of topics. These include weighing interpretations of King Phillip’s War, trauma, captivity, and the Salem Witch Trials in colonial New England; comparing national, global, and cultural histories of the trans-Atlantic slave trade; how to best explain the French Revolution; the ways cotton has shaped global capitalism; competing explanations for the rise of fascism, World War II, and the Holocaust; and the problem of revolutionary violence in a decolonizing, Cold War-era world, among other subjects. Students will write a series of brief responses to different sources, and four essays on questions of historical thought, methods, and analysis emerging from readings and discussion."
HIST,147,"As a requirement for students concentrating in History, this course surveys the grand sweep of American history, from Europeans’ first contacts with Native Americans in North America in the sixteenth century, to the more recent Great Recession. While weekly readings and discussion advance chronologically by reviewing the most significant developments inside the spatial boundaries of the polity that became the greater United States by the mid-twentieth century, the course also exceeds traditional narratives of U.S. history organized around the nation-state by asking how international, transnational, and global forces and ideas have shaped American life. It also structures a changing American past around three great tensions: those between empire and nation, exclusion and inclusion, and capitalism and democracy. Topics addressed in class include English and British, French, Spanish, and Dutch colonialisms and their changing relations with Native America and each other; the origins and growth of slavery, and the American Revolution in an age of revolutions in the Atlantic World; the rise of democracy, industrial capitalism and its opponents, and abolitionism, labor, women’s, and other social reform movements before the American Civil War, and afterwards; the global history of Reconstruction and racial segregation; the birth of American empire in the age of high imperialism; World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II; nuclear weapons, the security state, and the Cold War; the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, and the rise of new identity politics; the ascendancy of modern conservatism; and the origins and dynamics of neoliberalism in an age of climate crisis. Beyond exams, students will write weekly responses to primary sources, as well as several essays on some of the American history’s most pressing and persistent questions."
HIST,203,"Russia was born at the margins of the Western world and has been a site of conflict between Europe and Asia for more than 1,000 years. Christianized by Byzantium, conquered by the Mongols, and forcibly Westernized by Peter
the Great, it evolved a unique civilization viewed both as an exotic, primitive cousin of the West, and as its most threatening enemy. Nevertheless, Russia's rise to great power status, the stunning flowering of its secular culture, and the resistance of its peoples to a crushing autocratic state compel respect and admiration. This course explores Russia's complex historical development and rich cultural heritage from their 9th-century beginnings to the early 20th century, when an anachronistic imperial state stood on the eve of the revolutions that would destroy it. Course materials raise questions about our understandings of individual, sexual, and social liberation, the limits of political power, and the prospects for cross-cultural understanding. As is evidenced in the agonized interrogation of Russia's ""historical mission"" by her Westernized elite, Russia's
placement at the point where the boundary between ""East"" and ""West"" has been most permeable provides ample ground for reflection on the nature of both. Among the texts analyzed are writings by cultural and political figures such as Bakunin, Dostoevsky, and Gogol; works of popular culture; and classic Soviet cinematic representations of the Russian past, such as Eisenstein's
Ivan the Terrible and Andre Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev. No prerequisites.

HIST,204,"How did the “Workers’ Paradise” promised by Bolsheviks in the 1920s metamorphose into the “Evil Empire” demonized by President Reagan in the 1980s? Do Marxist revolutions inevitably fail? Did Russia’s authoritarian political culture assure that her history would take the murderous turn it did under Stalin? What can the utopian experiments of dissident Russian cultural radicals teach us about gender equality and individual identity? Does President Putin’s November, 2004, announcement of the  development of a new generation of nuclear weaponry signal the resumption of the arms race? This course searches 20th- and early 21st-century Russian history for answers to these questions, as we seek to understand a world where apprehension about a putative “international communist conspiracy” has been  replaced by fears of an international terrorism that seems to threaten all of the former antagonists of the Cold War.Readings include contrasting scholarly interpretations of controversial events, and primary sources such  as tracts by Bolshevik revolutionaries; Zamiatin’s dystopian novel We; Bulgakov’s anti-Stalinist fable The Master and Margarita; and E. Ginzburg’s memoir about her life in the Gulag. Also analyzed will be classic films such as Eisenstein’s Battleship Potemkin, and Kuleshov’s good-natured satire of American stereotypes of Russia, The Extraordinary Adventures  of Mr. West in the Land of the Bolsheviks .

HIST,205,"If there are goddesses in the Heavens, are women goddesses on earth? How did medieval queens with power in their own right turn into mere wives of the king by the 19th century? What was the fate of Benedetta Carlini, ¿the Lesbian nun¿ of Renaissance Italy? How did scientists overlook the ovum when exploring the mysteries of conception during the Scientific Revolution? Why was nobody shouting ¿Liberty, Equality, and Sorority,¿ during the French Revolution? How did ¿feminism¿ lose its connotation of ¿effeminate¿ and become the descriptor for the varied political movements which seek to liberate women? What ideology offers more to females: liberalism or socialism? This course does not promise definitive answers to these questions, but it does offer an exploration of the fortunes of women in European and American history from the medieval period to our current ¿postfeminist¿ era that affirms the centrality of their contributions, and enriches our understanding of the experiences of both genders in the past and present."
HIST,211,"Dominant narratives of American history tell of slavery's demise in 1865 and freedom's tortured though eventual triumph. Yet the mutually constituted categories of blackness and slavery over 400 years ago suggest an altogether different narrative. So too does the present: the grossly disproportionate rates of black incarceration in U.S. prisons, the near-stable link between blackness and poverty, the outrageous underdevelopment of black Africa in comparison to the industrialized North, and the existence of over 27 million enslaved people today. In short, the simple fact of white overprivilege and concomitant black disadvantage which exists on a global scale is powerful evidence against the progressive narrative of slavery in America. How can we move beyond facile narratives of slavery and freedom to imagine new ways to think about the past's claims on the present? This course takes as its central topic the rise of Atlantic African capitalist slavery, its life in narratives, and its continuing life in contemporary memory. By examining the links between the enslaved past and present, we will investigate the ways in which the ""memory"" of slavery still weighs upon the present to shape our lives. The course will be broken into four sections, each constituted by a pair of narratives, one historical and one contemporary: the African slave trade that brought bodies into servitude; the middle passage which transmuted those bodies into legal property; new world slavery which imparted racial dominance and resistance in the era of European empire; and African-American slavery which provided the legal foundations for white domination and freedom in the United States and the world. By examining how whites and enslaved peoples narrated and lived slavery in the past, as well as how whites and blacks remember and live slavery today, our hope is to acknowledge the complex and undying claims the past has on the present. Prerequisite for 300 level: Sophomore standing and two courses in either African-American Studies, History, Anthropology, or Sociology, or permission of the instructor."
HIST,217,"We can understand the story of American history as a series of discrete conflicts: between a strong centralized government and local sovereignty; between a large-scale, centralized capitalist economy and local economic systems and producers; and between a system of work largely divorced from the home lives of the workers and a system where the two are integrated. By the end of the American Civil War the balance of power in these conflicts had been tipped to one side or the other. But they were not (and are not) complete. How and why has the nation evolved from small, localized political and economic communities to a nation dominated by a centralized, bureaucratic state that fosters corporate capitalism on a national scale? How complete was that revolution in 1865? How complete is it today? This course is the first of a twopart critical analysis of these developments in American history. It will analyze these conflicts from the perspective of four related and contested narratives. We will follow the story of empire in North America: the conflicts over the growth and centralization of American state power. We will analyze the story of capitalism: the battles over the complementary growth and centralization of the American economy. We will assess these two narratives on the ground, by following the story of the household: looking at how ordinary men and women understood, contributed, and struggled against the changes occurring around them and how they affected work, the family, leisure, and reproduction. Finally, we will trace the story of ideas: how changing understandings of race, gender, and citizenship shaped American history to the Civil War."
HIST,224,"How did the cultural and economic backwater that was Europe in late antiquity come to constitute the core of a ""western civilization"" that would dominate the world by the end of the 19th century? How did classical Athens, Renaissance Italy, and Revolutionary France come to signify progress in human liberation, if women were excluded from progressive developments in all three?  Were the Crusades early examples of western imperialism? How were the bloody religious wars of the 16th-17th centuries linked to the rise of capitalism, democracy, and tolerance of dissent?  Do the French and Russian Revolutions demonstrate that all attempts to refashion polity, society, and economy are doomed to end in terror and dictatorship? Was the Nazi Holocaust an aberration in the history of the West, or one of its quintessential expressions? How is it that Eastern Europe ceased to be part of the West after World War II, while Japan was welcomed into it? These are among the questions that will be considered in this exploration of classic and contemporary debates about the nature and historical significance of Europe from the fifth c. BCE to the present. Against the backdrop of a survey of European history, students will analyze primary texts and contrasting scholarly treatments of a series of historical issues crucial for understanding our contemporary world, the place of Europe within it, and the contested nature of terms such as ""western civilization"" or ""the West."""
HIST,227,"This course examines how men and women of Indigenous, European, African, and Asian origin encountered the emergence and formation of the United States as a nation-state.

HIST,229,"Constituting roughly 2/3 of the nation's ""Latino"" population and historically concentrated in the Southwestern United States, Chicana/o peoples also have roots in the Midwest and the Pacific Northwest dating back to the late 19th and early 20th Centuries.  Further, in the latter half of the 20th Century, Mexican origin populations have grown exponentially in the South and the Northeastern portions of the country, making the emergence of Mexican communities a national phenomenon.  Thus, in an attempt to understand the totality of the Chicana/o experience, this course intends to focus on the experiences of Mexican origin communities in a national context. Topics covered for this course include but are not limited to the following:  Chicana/o Indigeneity, the Mexican American War and the subjugation of the Southwestern United States, the Great Migration Era (1900-1930), Repatriation (1930s), WWII and the Zoot Suit Riots, Labor Activism, Civil Rights, the Bracero Program, The Chicano Movement, and the ongoing Immigration debate."
HIST,231,"Americans have a peculiar relationship to the world around them. They work, play, shape, use, and invest in the environment at the same time they draw, photograph, and write about ""Nature."" But every time a person steps foot out of their front door, she or he understands the outside world and all those activities in it, in unique and individual ways. The timber company executive has a different view of nature than the loggers who cut the trees; the advertising firm that prints the REI catalogue thinks about wilderness differently than the people who hike, bike, and camp in it. Midwestern farmers, New York apartment dwellers, Texas cattle ranchers, and Jackson Hole ski bums all have different perceptions about American nature, and those individual perceptions help shape the different ways they interact with the non-human world. This course examines how Americans have perceived nature and how those perceptions have shaped the nation's history, both natural and social. It is split into four sections, beginning with how Americans have defined nature in literature, art, and popular culture. What do Americans identify as natural? What are its characteristics? Next, the course turns to what happens when Americans have put those visions into practice. How have Americans created so-called wilderness areas and at what cost? The course will also look at what American culture labels ""civilization"": cities, suburbs, and other supposedly human environments. Who is allowed in? Who is excluded and why? The course ends with a section on the living world. How and why have Americans manipulated plants and animals over time? Have they manipulated humans? In focusing on the cultural and material constructions of nature, students will not lose sight of the larger social history of American natural spaces. Who has labored in nature? How do racial and gender hierarchies help to define the American natural environment? How have ordinary Americans understood the natural landscape?"
HIST,232,"This course examines the recent histiographical shift from ""Classical Civil Rights Movement"" scholarship to what historians Singh and Hall have phrased the ""Long Civil Rights Movement.""  Primarily, we will focus our attention on how Long Civil Rights scholars stretch the timeline and re-orient the roots of Civil Rights struggles.  Additionally, this course will shift away from the black and white racial binary that dominates traditional Civil Rights scholarship by including works analyzing the American Indian and Chicana/Chicano movements.Prerequisites for this course are completion of one social studies class. For more advanced students, the course may be taken at the 300-level via permission of instructor. This course offers credit toward the College's Cultural Perspectives distribution requirement for the AA. Prerequisite: Completion of one 200-level social studies class."
HIST,234,"While goods such as computers and smart phones pervade our lives, commodities of all kinds have long made the modern world, since the sixteenth-century origins of world capitalism. This course introduces students to global history by organizing the history of globalization, and our increasingly interconnected world, around three commodities: sugar, cotton, and rubber. We not only discuss how these goods have been used as materials, but explore how their production, circulation, and consumption in different economies, cultures, and societies linked Europe and Europeans to the rest of the world. The history of industrialized foods, textiles, and latex reveals an interwoven history of colonial conquest, plantation slavery and the slave trade, industrialization and deindustrialization, nation and empire-building, consumer culture, and ecological and human exploitation which have created the globalized planet we inhabit today. HIST 110: Introduction to History, is not required but recommended."
HIST,237,"This course offers a broad overview of 1960's era social movements in the United States through an examination of historical works revolving around the American Indian Movement, Black Power, the Chicano Movement, the Gay Revolution and Women's Liberation along with a general chronology of the era.  Also, some attention will be paid towards understanding ""the Sixties"" in a larger global context.  Additionally, our evaluation will engage these Movements within the context of both primary and secondary sources in order to provide breadth. Prerequisites: Completion of any introductory level Social Sciences/Studies course."
HIST,242,"Wielding both temporal and spiritual authority, the Papacy was one of the most significant political and religious institutions in medieval Western Europe. This course studies the  development of Papal power from its early days in the second and third-centuries, through the late thirteenth centuries. The course asks the questions: How is it that the medieval Catholic Papacy in Rome garnered enough power to launch Christian Crusades in Muslim territories? How did the medieval papacy come to “manage” Jewish residents in Western Christendom as an exceptional minority? What was the long-term? impact of the fourth century imperialization of the Church, and how did this produce the imperial imaginary of papal Rome? Finally, once the popes harnessed the newly-founded law schools in Bologna in the eleventh century, how did they fashion legal notions of papal sovereignty and unleash their powers upon Western Christendom? The course, taught as a seminar, is based on close reading of medieval primary sources in translation and close reading of material culture including catacombs, basilicas, synagogues, mosques, and museum exhibitions. No prerequisites.

HIST,244,"This course surveys U.S. foreign relations history through military conflicts and military government at the nation’s shifting territorial and cultural borders, from the founding to the present. Although American expansion often proceeded beyond North America through “soft power,” or economic and cultural hegemony, by the mid-twentieth century the United States had won great-power status through successive foreign wars and military occupations. Examining conflicts with Native Americans, Mexico, the Civil War and Reconstruction in the American South, military interventions and rule in Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Haiti, and Dominican Republic, and occupations in World War II-era France, Germany, and Japan shows great change, and perhaps even some continuities, over time in how Americans made war on foreign peoples, and governed them. This course satisfies the Writing Intensive requirement, and a history course, such as History 110: Introduction to History or History 247: American History, or other social studies course, is recommended."
HIST,246,"[Under Review]: This course examines the history of the Ottoman Empire from its origins in the early 14th century to its eventual demise at the conclusion of the First World War. The Ottoman Empire stood at the intersection of global events for almost six centuries. It was heir both to the Caliphate and the Byzantine Empire, and emerged as the preeminent Early Modern power in the Mediterranean and Middle East before eventually limping through the long 19th century. The remnants of the Ottoman Empire make up today’s modern Middle East, and the history of the Empire, especially the terms of its collapse, help us to understand the region currently. This course considers, among other issues, these competing claims about the Ottoman example: on the one hand the Ottoman Empire as a lesson in the failure to modernize; on the other as a model for multi-ethic and multi-religious co-existence in a non-nationalist culture.

While weekly readings and discussion advance chronologically by reviewing the most significant developments inside the spatial boundaries of the polity that became the greater United States by the mid-twentieth century, the course also exceeds traditional narratives of U.S. history organized around the nation-state by asking how international, transnational, and global forces and ideas have shaped American life. It also structures a changing American past around three great tensions: those between empire and nation, exclusion and inclusion, and capitalism and democracy. Topics addressed in class include English and British, French, Spanish, and Dutch colonialisms and their changing relations with Native America and each other; the origins and growth of slavery, and the American Revolution in an age of revolutions in the Atlantic World; the rise of democracy, industrial capitalism and its opponents, and abolitionism, labor, women’s, and other social reform movements before the American Civil War, and afterwards; the global history of Reconstruction and racial segregation; the birth of American empire in the age of high imperialism; World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II; nuclear weapons, the security state, and the Cold War; the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, and the rise of new identity politics; the ascendancy of modern conservatism; and the origins and dynamics of neoliberalism in an age of climate crisis. Beyond exams, students will write weekly responses to primary sources, as well as several essays on some of the American history’s most pressing and persistent questions."
HIST,248,"In many ways, the United States and the world today is a product of profound events and changes between the Second World War and the 1980s. Protests, revolutions, and wars rocked the globe, along with new kinds of politics, social consciousness, and art, not only in North America and Europe, but also Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Challenging traditionally nation-bounded narratives of the 1960s as a period of political, social, and cultural turmoil contained within the United States and Europe, this course adopts a transnational and global frame which treats ""the Global Sixties"" as a worldwide phenomenon of disruptive forces which transformed the world, and integrated it through new and stronger connections. It uses oral history and film in addition to historical scholarship and original historical sources to address the kaleidoscopic public and personal memories that inform our knowledge of this critical era today. No prerequisites."
HIST,250,"What is ""the West""? Scholars debate terms such as frontier, borderland, internal colony, or middle ground, while in the realm of popular culture Americans have even more contentious debates over what constitutes the American West and its history. Indeed, it seems that in Western history, myths and material reality have gone hand in hand in shaping the history of the region. This course is a survey
of the history and culture of the region Americans labeled ""the West."" We will examine three major questions that shape the scholarship of the region. First, as a regional history, we will investigate what constitutes a region, and what benefit, if any, a regional focus gives us as historians. What forces make a region cohere? Does ""the West"" have a common or contested sense of place and regional identity? As a peripheral space, what is its relationship to political and economic centers of power? Second, because ""the West"" occupies such an important place within the realm of American myth, we will examine how cultural perceptions
of the region has shaped its history. How has the federal government and capitalism understood the region? How have Western residents perceived their own region? What role has the ""imagined West"" played in popular culture--
art, photography, dime novels, movies, and television? Finally, we will look at the West as a space of racial, ethnic, and intercultural contact, conflict, and compromise. Geographies of empire and labor created enclaves of Europeans, Native Americans, Asians, and Hispanics. The legacy of contact and conquest shapes the West to this day."
HIST,251,"Did the ancient Greeks enjoy sex without guilt? Did Christianity lead to the repression of sexual expression among medieval Europeans? Did the bawdy language of Shakespeare’s time connote freedom in sex and love? Did the Victorian era take its cue from the queen whom Michel Foucault dubbed ""the Imperial Prude"" and silence all thoughts of sexuality? Was the sexual revolution of the sixties really revolutionary? These questions and others will be considered in this survey of the history of love, sex, and sexuality from fifth century Athens to the present. In doing so we will problematize common conceptions of this history as a dialectic between freedom and repression, as well as the biological determinism often at the heart of discussions of these topics. Course materials include classic and contemporary scholarship on love and sex in the West (e.g. Foucault, de Beauvoir, Halperin) and key primary texts (e.g. Shakespeare, de Sade, Tolstoy, Freud).  Prerequisite: One Social Science Course or permission of the instructor."
HIST,260,"In Heart of Darkness, the classic novel of imperial Britain, Joseph Conrad's arch-imperial protagonist writes of the ""blank spaces of delightful mystery"" that were incompassed by and constituted through maps. This course seeks to chart the place of maps in history and to explore their role in the constitution of relations of power. Maps, as scholars have told us, are an impressively aggressive system of knowledge production. They assert control and dominion. They ""clarify"" and simplify the messiness of everyday materiality. Cartography's genius and its conceit is that it can  re-present reality on paper. Part of the process of cartography is an attempt to abolish the distinction between the map and its representation-object. The map becomes what we see, obliterating all that was once material by simple fact of its absence. In this way, the social is written onto the landscape and the two become seemingly more solid and stable than they ever were. It is a beautiful elision, but it is also a violence. Focusing on the modern period since the enlightenment, we will interrogate maps and their place in Anglo-American culture. The course will focus on the influence of maps in four historico-social institutions: the institution of western science, the course of empire, the modern nation state, and the rise of corporate capitalism. Beginning in the Enlightenment and continuing through the end of the twentieth century, the course will be divided into five chronological/thematic components: I Cartography and the Enlightenment; II Mapping and Empire; III Censuses, Biopower, and State Building; IV Knowing and Engineering Nature; and V Capitalism and Cartography.

"
HIST,261,"This course examines the history of the Middle East from the close of the First World War to the Arab Spring. The course will focus on the emergence of nationalism in the region; the significance of oil; the effects of the Second World War and the Cold War; and the appearance of cultural, social, and intellectual responses to the challenges of modernization and westernization.

"
HIST,302,"Michel Foucault argued that we are ""individuals"" not because of our  talents and preferences,  but because we deviate in varied ways from an imposed norm; that sex is not a biological given, but an historically contingent concept used to defend ""the normal"" from ""the abnormal;"" that anything (and therefore nothing distinctive) can be deduced from the domination of the bourgeoisie;  and that therapists in liberal democracies share with the police of totalitarian dictatorships a common ancestor in medieval Christian priests.  He thus engaged in a series of provocative dialogues with other thinkers that challenged western notions of the apriori human subject; re-conceptualized the relationship of power and knowledge in academic and political discourse; and redefined what it meant to be an intellectual in the postmodern world.  Noting that Foucault's work is relevant to important new understandings of the social sciences, the arts, literary criticism, and politics, this course analyzes the fruitful encounters of his ideas with past and present critical theory; post-structuralism; and feminist and post-colonial analyses of marginalization and resistance.  It thus explores possibilities for creating a future freer and more just than the present which so exercised Foucault's iconoclastic ire.    Prerequisite: Upper Division Status or permission of the instructor.  (4 credits). This course satisfies a core requirement in two concentrations: Historical Studies and Contemporary Critical Theory.

"
HIST,306,"This course examines the recent histiographical shift from ""Classical Civil Rights Movement"" scholarship to what historians Singh and Hall have phrased the ""Long Civil Rights Movement.""  Primarily, we will focus our attention on how Long Civil Rights scholars stretch the timeline and re-orient the roots of Civil Rights struggles.  Additionally, this course will shift away from the black and white racial binary that dominates traditional Civil Rights scholarship by including works analyzing the American Indian and Chicana/Chicano movements."
HIST,319,"What is power? Who has it, who doesn't, and why? How do the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots"" fight, negotiate, and exterminate each other in a given society? This course examines these questions through the lens of ""hegemony"" --the mass consent given to the established order of society, and the simultaneous opposition that develops to that order--articulated by Italian theorist Antonio Gramsci and subsequent scholars who have built on his work. Gramsci argued that although we may believe the elite hold a privileged, or hegemonic, position in society, their power and domination are often tenuous at best. As post-colonial theorist Stuart Hall once remarked, ""hegemonizing is hard work."" We will investigate past societies and the world around us attempting to account for differences in power, authority, prestige, the thickness of people's wallets and the bareness or bounty of their cupboards. The course will engage literature that has focused on 1) the tools of the dominant group used to maintain authority in society, 2) the agency of the oppressed, and how they have (or have not) been able to shape the world around them to their best interests; and 3) the larger social dialogue or interaction between those supposedly with power and those supposedly without. By examining coercive violence and subtle tools of consent in view of revolutionary violence and subtle forms of protest, we will be better able to understand how scholars have imagined domination, oppression, resistance, and radical change. The class is not intended to offer a ""best"" theory, or to impose a ""progressive narrative"" in which the most recent theory is the best. Each set of theories is essentially a set of tools--some are better suited for some tasks than others, some may be suggestive but flawed, others may seem to be useless for the tasks that interest you. But, with each set of theories and concepts we acquire, we have a greater number of tools to draw on in our research and writing. Prerequisite: Sophomore seminar or approval of instructor."
HIST,325,"The course covers the period in European history from 1350-1600 traditionally called the Renaissance. Its focus is on cultural, intellectual and political developments particularly in Western and Central Europe (England, France, Spain, Italy, the Lowlands, and Germany). In addition to addressing key themes during this period – humanism and the recovery of Antiquity, innovations in art and architecture, global exploration and colonial conquest, the literacy/printing revolution, religious reform and the opening phase of Early Modern science – this course will, given the various controversies attending the term since the end of the Second World War, interrogate the concept of Renaissance itself. Prerequisites: one 200-level course in history, philosophy, politics, art history, or literature; or permission of the instructor."
HIST,326,"This class examines American history through humans¿ interactions with animals¿wild, domestic, and symbolic. Animals occupy a large cultural and social space in American life, from folk stories to motion pictures, from scientific objects to stuffed toys, from wilderness to farmyards to zoos. The course traces the ways real and imagined animals have wandered into and affected American history. Using theoretical tools from social and cultural history, environmental history, and political and cultural ecology, we will investigate the roles animals play in colonization, industrialization, recreation, science, politics, and popular culture. The course will explore three foundational questions: 1) how has ¿American culture¿ constructed animals through various cultural discourses; 2) how have animals themselves (their material presence) affected social relations between different human aspects of society and between humans and animals; and 3) how have those discursive formations and material relations influenced different human subjectivities. Pre-Reqs: Completion of coursework at the 200 level (or above) in one of the following disciplines: Environmental Studies, Biology, Environmental history, or Political Ecology."
HIST,328,"This course examines the formation, nature, and critiques of American middle-class identity from the eighteenth century to the present.  Co-taught by a professor of literature and an historian, the course draws extensively on both literary and historical materials.  Topics of study include the emergence of middle-class mores and material culture, the ways that changes in work and leisure affected class identity, and contemporary debates over membership in the middle class. We examine how gender, race, and region inflected class status and identification and also consider historical critiques of the middle class from both 'above' and 'below.' Prerequisites: Sophomore Seminar or permission of instructor."
HIST,330,"This course focuses on the ways that human sexuality has been interpreted in the West. Situated at the boundary between the biological and the social, human sexual connection has been feared for its explosive potential to disrupt all other forms of human organization, and interrogated as the key to understanding human nature and individual identity. Sexual behavior has long been the object of religious and state proscription, and concerns about it arguably underlie most methods of state control. Sigmund Freud, the quintessential theorist of modern sexuality, argued that Eros and Thanatos (Love and Death) ruled the world--humans are perpetually caught between elemental drives toward connection and reproduction on the one hand, and the destruction of all life on the other. In Classical Greece, sexual practices were inextricably bound to the education of the male citizen, and love was an aesthetic, spiritual, and corporal experience, which, in Plato's view was crucial to the right and true order of the Polis. While medieval Christians emphasized the association of sex with sin, and insisted on the linkage of true love with the divine, nineteenth century Victorians have been accused of linking humans only by the callous “cash nexus.” Many contemporary scholars (e. g. Michel Foucault) argue that sexuality itself is an historically contingent phenomenon enacting shifting power relationships of all sorts, and question the privileged place it has been accorded in the explanation of human affairs. This course features a close reading of texts (including films, music, art) that have been considered classic expressions of Western understandings of sexuality. Included will be works by authors such as Simone de Beauvoir, the Marquis de Sade, Freud, Foucault, Mozart, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy. On occasion we will have guest faculty to provide perspectives that will enrich our own. This course may be counted as a BA Seminar, or as a core course in the Historical Studies, or Contemporary Critical Theory Concentrations. Prerequisite: Junior Standing or permission of the instructor."
HIST,333,"This course is designed to provide students with an historical overview of the economic, political, and sociocultural forces that have shaped and reshaped the American city after World War II.  The themes in urban history that will be addressed include immigration/migration, planning and design, politics, poverty, public policy, suburbanization, the urban ""crisis"", gentrification, and ""white flight."" Analysis will factor in class, gender, and race, as well as historical processes of continuity and change as they impact social transformation in urban spaces. Prerequisites: Completion of History 228, 229, 232, or 237 or permission of the instructor."
HIST,339,"This course examines Race, Labor, and Immigration in the Borderlands region of the American Southwest, and thus shifts the axis of Immigration History from Ellis Island to Angels Island and the U.S.-Mexico Border.  The course will provide a historical overview of a evolving Immigration laws rooted in racial preferences, demands for migrant labor, and the expansion of U.S. Economic interests beginning with the laws leading to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 through the current period.  Special attention will be placed on major themes revolving around issues of industrial expansion into the Borderlands region, the rise of U.S. Empire, the militarization of the U.S.-Mexico Border, the creation of “illegality”, labor rights, guest worker programs, immigration reform, and the Homeland Security State."
HIST,350,"Fascism was the political innovation of the 20th century. It was—and still is—an intellectually and culturally formidable political form that carved out for itself a unique position in the market place of ideologies – anti-materialism based on hyper-nationalism, that is, opposition to the common materialism of liberalism and communism in favor of a mystical sense of nation. In this course, we will examine the ideological origins of fascism in the early decades of the 20th century, consider the First World War as a crucible of revolutionary right wing movements, study the original model of fascism in Mussolini’s Italy, and then consider the most fascinating – and perhaps least representative – version of fascism, Nazi Germany. The course will conclude with investigations into post-WW II fascist movements including contemporary neo-fascisms in Europe, Asia, Africa and the New World. Prerequisites are completion of Seminar III and one prior intermediate (200-level) course in history, philosophy, or politics."
HIST,131M,"The main focus of this course will be the history and culture of Nicaragua and their relation to the nation’s economic systems. This course also introduces students to the topic of poverty both as an empathic starting point for social analysis and as a structure within which much social analysis and history contends, focusing here on to women and children in rural Nicaragua.  To such an extent we read about American imperialism in Nicaragua, US politicians in the mid-twentieth century, the history of the Nicaraguan revolution in 1979 and the US response to the revolution, Nicaraguan economics in relation to central American economies more broadly, and economic effects of recent market developments. Special attention will be given to the imaginings of the global South, the poor, and Nicaragua in the minds of people in the US, particularly how poverty is understood and/or experienced by people in the academy, in the US, and in Nicaragua. Prerequisite: for 200-level: One course in the social studies or permission of the instructor. For 300-level: one intermediate- or higher-level course in social sciences and Seminar III. If there is sufficient student interest and commitment, the course may be extended to include a Spring Break service course working with women and children in Nicaragua in partnership with a similar program from Naropa University (this course extension would include a course fee for travel)."
HIST,234M,"This course provides an introduction to selected topics in the history of American sexuality in the 19th and early 20th centuries and to major debates and trends in the scholarship of this field.  Areas of focus include the Victorian sexual ideologies and practices; the emergence and articulation of new sexual identities beginning in the late 19th century; and the relationship between sexuality and citizenship.  In addition to examining changes in both the questions asked and the sources consulted by historians from the 1970s to the present, the course looks closely at the often surprising contestations over sexual identifications and expressions. While this course is a Mod-1, and is scheduled to meet twice a week, some meeting times likely will be rescheduled, and students should be prepared to attend some class meetings after the midterm, if needed. There are no prerequisites for this course."
HIST,238M,This course examines the history of medicine and public health in the United States from the colonial period to the present.  Topics to be discussed include the cultural construction of sickness; changing conceptions of science and the body; the emergence of “orthodox” medicine and challenges to it; the implications of the germ theory of disease; debates over the use of human subjects in medical testing; and the role of the state in providing and regulating health care. No prerequisites.
INTC,108,"This course, designed for international students, examines aspects of contemporary American cultures and society, while emphasizing the development and refinement of the students’ English language skills. Through the treatment and analysis of various texts, films, and articles from the mainstream media, students gain insight into the role of American government and its ruling principles and examine the impact that immigration from all parts of the world has on the origin and development of a society that is often referred to as a “melting pot”. In addition to increasing their cultural and intercultural understanding, students will also aim to improve their command of advanced structures of English grammar and usage."
INTC,315,"If there is ""not one single shred of evidence"" to support the widely accepted theory that myths were primitive explanations of natural phenomena, then the question remains, whence and wherefore myth? In this course we will closely examine five complex models for understanding mythology. Carl Jung broke from Freud with an alternate and equally influential theory involving ""archetypes"" in a ""collective unconscious,"" wherein, he said, could be found all the patterns of myth across all cultures. In The Sacred and the Profane Mircea Eliade describes the people of myth-oriented societies as homo religiosus, and compares and contrasts this mode of being in the world with a contemporary secular common sense of reality. Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend's fugal essay, ""Hamlet's Mill,"" follows the single, very ancient myth of Hamlet all over the world, and finds encoded in this myth the origins of human science. Do Kamo: Person and Myth in the Melanesian World by anthropologist Maurice Leenhardt is a case study of a myth-oriented people that confronts us with counterintuitive constructions of the human being, nature, and society. And in Saving the Appearances (quoted above), English philosopher Owen Barfield proposes some far-reaching conclusions based on premises from quantum physics, anthropology, and an historical examination of language. By applying these authors' observations and meditations to a cross-section of traditional tales from a variety of cultures, we will cultivate our faculty of imagining myth and thus engage mythology on its own terms as a storehouse of meaning. Prerequisite: Sophomore standing, or permission of the instructor. Some previous study of mythology is recommended."
LATN,100,"Latin is the language not only of Vergil, Cicero, Horace, Catullus and Tacitus, but also of poets, historians, scientists, philosophers and theologians through the time of St. Augustine down to the Middle Ages and on into the Renaissance and beyond.  It is the language in which western culture was transmitted to Western Europe, beside being the source of a large proportion of English vocabulary.   Students with no (or relatively little) previous experience of Latin will acquire a working knowledge of the language.   Latin will be learned as a language spoken and heard in the classroom, not as abstract rules and paradigms.  We will speak, chant, sing and perform skits in Latin, in addition  to reading.  Explanations will  be given in English, and we will practice translating in both directions.  By the end of the spring  continuation of this course, students will be able to hold their own in conversation and also, with the aid of a dictionary, to read most Latin authors.

LATN,101,"Latin is the language not only of Virgil, Cicero, Horace, Catullus and Tacitus, but also of poets, historians, scientists, philosophers, and theologians through the time of St. Augustine down to the Middle Ages and on into the Renaissance and even beyond. It is the language in which Western culture was transmitted to Western Europe or first invented, besides being the source of a large proportion
of English vocabulary. In this two semester course, students with no (or relatively little) previous experience of Latin acquire a working knowledge of the language. As far as possible, Latin is learned as a language spoken and heard in the classroom. We speak, chant, sing, and perform skits in Latin, in addition to reading. Explanations are, of course, given in English, and we practice translating in both directions. By the end of the year, students are able to hold their own in conversation and also, with the aid of a dictionary, to read most Latin authors. Prerequisite: Latin 100."
LATN,204,"Designed for students who have completed Accelerated Beginning Latin or its equivalent, i.e., about one year of college Latin or a number of years of high school Latin. The course focuses on the study of a significant portion of one of
the greatest works of Latin literature, the Aeneid of Virgil. The parts of the epic not read in Latin will be read in English translation. This is the student's first experience of reading an extended Latin text, and so we will work on techniques of
translation, vocabulary building, and recitation. Attention is also devoted to mastering meter and poetic language. Throughout the semester we will look at the literary background of the tragic love affair between Aeneas and Dido
and the role of the epic as an interpretation of Roman History and specifically of the Augustan Age. Prerequisite: Latin 101 or permission of the instructor."
LATN,205,"Designed for students who have completed Latin 204 or have read, either in High School or College, extended Latin texts for the equivalent of one college semester. The Eunuchus of Terence will be read and studied in Latin. Many other Roman comedies will be read in English translation. We will focus on the nature of Roman comedy, which will also give  insight into the everyday spoken language of the Romans. Roman comedy will be viewed in the context of Hellenistic Greek comedy, often called “New Comedy,” and also, in a final paper, in relation to either Shakespeare or Molière, each of whom wrote at least one comedy based on a Roman play. Prerequisite: Latin 204 or its equivalent (see instructor for placement)."
LATN,304,"This course is designed for students who have completed Latin 205 or have had the equivalent of one year's experience in reading extended Latin texts. This course deals with writers and works that are not well known to the average reader. The focus is determined by the participants themselves, and depends on their desires and previous reading experience. Similarly, each student has significant input regarding individual paper topics and presentations in class. For this reason, Latin 304 readily accommodates not only varying experiences with the language, but also differing interests and expertise on the part of students.
Prerequisite: Latin 205 or its equivalent (see instructor for placement)."
LING,100,"This course presents an overview of the field of linguistics, introducing basic concepts, topics, and analytic methods. It includes study of the structure of language (systems of sound, structure, and meaning), nonverbal communication, historical and comparative linguistics, and language acquisition. No prerequisites."
LING,101,"This course presents and reviews the rules and formative processes of English grammar. Students will work with grammatical exercises and then apply their knowledge learning how to organize sentences and paragraphs and to structure and develop their ideas in papers. The course is designed to help students improve their writing skills by learning formal rules of grammar. It is also designed for students who are good writers but who want to finally learn what English grammar is all about. Grades will be based on daily grammar exercises, class participation, and a final exam. This course adds to offerings in English, in writing, in linguistics, and in the study of language. However, this course does not count towards fulfillment of the language requirement. No prerequisites."
LING,212,"Considering the world-wide importance of the English language in the twenty-first century, this module aims to introduce students to a rapidly growing field of study that offers a lot of employment opportunities in this country and abroad.  Students will be introduced to the challenges that recent immigrants to the US experience when learning English.  We will focus on the differences between first and second language acquisition and will explore ways in which understanding, speaking, reading, and writing skills are developed."
LING,213,"(Prerequisite: simultaneous enrollment in LING 212 m)Students who are able to secure a one-on-one tutoring position or an ESL-classroom assistant position through one of the established ESL programs in the southern Berkshire County are invited to this one-credit, pass/fail opportunity.  They should contact the instructor prior to enrollment."
LING,216,"This course examines interconnections between language and power relations.  Language form and linguistic usage are shown to be influenced by contextual features of inequalities in the social power of participants.  Linguistic usage is informed by such parameters as class, gender, race, ethnicity, and social status as demonstrated by casual and formal interactions in everyday contexts as well as in institutional settings such as medicine and law.  The role that language in the media plays in solidifying and furthering social and political power relations will also be studied. Prerequisites: One course in social studies or linguistics."
LING,218,"This course examines relationships between language and gender.  Specifically, how and to what extent are gender differences manifested in language?  Do women and men employ alternatives of pronunciation, vocabulary and grammatical structure?  Are men's and women's conversational strategies significantly different?  Do languages encode divergent cultural messages about women and men through the ways in which they label or talk about people?  Although the majority of data considered is derived from English, linguistic and cultural evidence from other societies will also be explored. Prerequisites: One course in social studies or linguistics."
LING,280,"This course explores the development of the English language, including Old English, Middle English, Early Modern English, and contemporary English. In addition to studying the internal history of English, the course will emphasize social and political events that shaped and transformed the language. We will also pay attention to literatures of the different historical periods and the development
of a writing system and spelling rules. We will examine various dialects that developed as English grew more and more prominent to assume the status of a world language."
LING,304,"This course examines the structures of Native American languages. It consists of readings that present the phonological, morphological, syntactic, and semantic systems of languages representing each of the language families indigenous to North America. Prerequisite: Linguistics 100 or equivalent."
LING,305,"This course presents readings in theories and methods of morphological and syntactic analysis. Readings and analytic problems acquaint students with principles of analyzing word formation patterns (morphology) and of phrasal and sentence construction (syntax). Structural and generative theories will be explored. Data will be drawn from indigenous, non-European, and European languages. Prerequisite: Linguistics 100 or its equivalent."
LING,307,"In this course, students will learn the techniques of linguistic field research by working with a native speaker of a language other than English (ideally a non-European language). Through this work, they will develop the skills involved in organizing and planning elicitation sessions and then they will use the data that they collect in order to analyze word and clause formation, and discourse style. Prerequisite: Introduction to Linguistics or its equivalent."
LING,01A,"In this course, we will begin the study of language. We will not be studying any particular language, but rather the structure of language itself. Topics that will be explored include the systems of sounds that exist in human languages, the ways that words are constructed internally and the ways that words are put together into larger constructions such as phrases and sentences.  In addition to readings, students will start to analyze language patterns by working with exercises and data beginning with English but then including problems from many languages throughout the world in order to get a sense of the variety of methods used to construct words and sentences.
"
LING,105M,"Much can be learned about the history of English simply by looking at the words it has acquired over the centuries. Beginning with an examination of where English falls within the family of Indo-European languages, we then look at the different developmental stages of English while concurrently studying the historical context.  Topics include doublets from Old Norse and Old English (e.g. Skirt vs. Shirt) and from Norman French and later French (e.g. Warden vs. Guardian). We also look at the Greek and Latin roots of English by examining the etymological origins of thematic groups including medicine, politics, and government—an important topic, given that in the sciences, over 90% of the words have Greek or Latin roots."
LING,220M,"This course reflects the growing academic (as well as popular) interest in understanding both the techniques of online communication, its lexical and stylistic innovations, and the social parameters and consequences of the utilization of an increasing array of contextual types and formats.  In this course, we study and evaluate the contributions of anthropological linguistics, conversation analysis, discourse and narrative theory to this growing contemporary field. We also explore cross-cultural studies of online communication, demonstrating both trends towards global homogeneity in some linguistic features as well as distinctive cultural interactions and their interpretations. Prerequisite:  one course in linguistics or social studies.

LIT,100,"This course gives students the opportunity to get to know the work of the authors who are visiting campus as part of the Poetry and Fiction series in a given semester. Course work includes attending the authors' four public readings, as well as the afternoon master classes offered by each writer, and one preparatory session on each writer, for which students read and prepare a presentation on one of the writer's works. Students write responses to each of these sessions and complete a final project, which might be a review for the newspaper, an analytical paper, or a story, personal essay, or poem in imitation of one of the writers. No prerequisites."
LIT,101,"This course offers students the opportunity to write personal essays about the natural world while also studying some classic and contemporary nature writers. Regular writing assignments and activities will be complemented by discussion of selected readings by classic and contemporary nature writers. In the tradition of many nature writers, we will occasionally make use of our own “backyard” (in this case, the College campus) as a source for observation, writing, and reflection. At the end of the module students will submit a portfolio of their work that includes both the informal and formal writing done during the course, a nature journal, a
major revision of an earlier piece, and a substantial selfevaluation. Students interested in the sciences as well as the humanities are encouraged to enroll. No prerequisites."
LIT,106,"Creative nonfiction is sometimes called “the fourth genre,” or the literature of reality. It includes various forms of writing based upon personal experience, including personal narratives, personal essays, memoirs, literary journalism, and more experimental lyric or hybrid essays. During the term, students write a series of working drafts, which are then read and discussed in class. In addition, students read and discuss the work of published authors in the field and engage in informal exercises that help to expand their awareness of style, content, structure, and point of view. At the end of the module students submit a portfolio of their work that includes all of the working drafts, a major revision of one of these drafts, a write-up of an oral presentation on at least one of the assigned writers, a writer’s journal, and a substantial self-evaluation. No prerequisites."

LIT,151,"This is a creative writing workshop that uses some of the techniques and strategies of translation to provide students with a unique means of generating material for their writing. While students with at least a year of foreign language study will be encouraged to work directly from the original, no prior knowledge of a foreign language is required. Exercises will include the adaptation of a classical poem to a more contemporary idiom, work on new versions of previously translated poems or stories, the alteration of a text's voice and imagery to affect its dramatic context, and the creation of original works through imitation. Specific emphasis will be given to stylistic and tonal choices made in the translation process. Completion of the course serves as a prerequisite for advanced writing workshops. No prerequisites."
LIT,152,"Frank O'Connor once wrote that an inferior writer could still be a great novelist, but that no inferior writer could ever be a great storyteller. After touching on the roots of storytelling in fable, parable, and tale, we will focus on the work of
major storytellers (a.k.a. short story writers) of the 19th and 20th centuries, exploring their contributions to the ongoing evolution of this literary genre. Writers studied include Poe, Hawthorne, Maupassant, Chekhov, Joyce, Mansfield, Kafka, Hemingway, O'Connor (Flannery), Borges, and Munro--as well as new voices from Jhumpa Lahiri to Junot Diaz.

LIT,155,"Long before becoming president, Barack Obama began exploring his origins in Dreams from My Father.  Later, in The Audacity of Hope, he described how his mother and her family shaped his worldview.  Writers turn to autobiography to explain themselves to themselves and the wider world; readers find inspiration and encouragement in others’ life stories for their own self-reflection. 
In this course students read several contemporary autobiographies and begin writing their own life stories.  Two of the primary texts are graphic works: Persepolis in which Marjane Satrapi describes her childhood in Iran in the 1960s, and Fun Home, where Alison Bechdel describes her own coming out and its impact on her father who lived closeted throughout her childhood.  We also read selections from personal stories of people from a wide variety of backgrounds.  Students keep response journals, and write two papers, one of which may be a personal memoir."
LIT,156,"Starting with some of the earliest examples of motion pictures dating back to 1895, this course examines a selection of films that are significant in the development of cinema as an art form. We will investigate the various ways in which the artistic impulse found a place in this new medium, including avant-garde and experimental works, as well as the narrative form as realized in such acknowledged masterpieces as Citizen Kane and Vertigo. In conjunction with the viewing of these films, the class will examine and discuss a number of significant essays on the nature of art and cinema. Through close analysis of film sequences, as well as through discussion and readings of film theory and criticism, the class will seek to develop critical viewing skills, an understanding of cinematic structure, and an appreciation of cinema’s place in the Arts.

LIT,157,"This course explores drama as a literary genre and mode of artistic expression as it has evolved from the 5th century BCE to the present. Across plays from varied historical, cultural, and artistic contexts, we will pursue some of the questions raised by drama: how does the concept of performance shape our sense of identity? What is the relationship between form and content? What is the relationship between author, actor, and audience in the construction of meaning? Readings will cover a range of significant eras and genres in the history of drama. Prospective texts include Antigone (Sophocles), Hamlet (Shakespeare), Tartuffe (Molière), The Rover (Behn), The Doll House (Ibsen), Pygmalion (Shaw), Trifles (Glaspell), A Streetcar Named Desire (Williams), Death and the King’s Horseman (Soyinka), and M.

LIT,158,"What is poetry and what do poems ask of the reader and the poet alike? This course provides the skills essential to the understanding of lyric poetry, as well as an appreciation for the rich tradition of poetry as an art form. Besides gaining familiarity with the historical developments of poetry in English, students will also study the uses of rhythm, rhyme, meter, tone, voice, metaphor, imagery, and formal strategies in the making of poems. They will then employ these skills in writing critical papers on poems, as well as in writing and sharing their own poetry in class. The aim is to discover the “lyric moment” that poetry opens up for us as both readers and writers, and to use that to deepen our understanding of the nuances of language and art. There are no prerequisites for the course.

We will also read several key theoretical essays that trace differing approaches to translation and what can or cannot be expected from translation. Finally, students will also take on a short translation project of their own in order to explore firsthand what it means to translate. Comparative readings will include brief excerpts of several pages from translations of Homer, Sappho, Plato, the Bible, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Baudelaire, Proust, Kafka, Babel, Rilke, Neruda, Basho, Li Po, and Celan. Essays on translation will include those by Dryden, Schleiermacher, Humboldt, Goethe, Benjamin, Valéry, Paz, and Nabokov.

Drawing on both print and online resources, we will explore the history of the media in the U.S. and its current state today, asking questions such as: What is the role of the so-called alternative media today, and which media outlets are best at performing this role?  What impact has the widespread use of social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. had on the business and practice of journalism, as well as on our political system?

By fostering the knowledge and skills essential to the understanding of poetry, this course cultivates the sensibilities crucial to a rich and full enjoyment of verse, as well as to help our lives become richer in thought and feeling through reading poems. By placing classic poems side by side with contemporary poems, we will examine what they share, what they do not, and just how they ask us as readers to inhabit ""imaginary gardens with real toads in them."""

By examining a field that so readily participates in and comments upon popular culture, this course raises questions about the conversation between art and society, and explores specific concerns about representations of history, memory, and identity. The graphic novels, comics, webcomics, and other forms of sequential art are drawn from a range of writers and artists, including Art Spiegelman, Marjane Satrapi, Chris Ware, Alison Bechdel, Los Brothers Hernandez, and others."

Dystopia, or ""bad place,"" features the opposite approach, depicting societies broken by authoritarian regimes, environmental catastrophe, and/or economic, racial, and gender oppression. In literature, the concepts of utopia and dystopia often work together; writers imagine alternate pasts and possible futures in order to illuminate the social and systemic dynamics of the world around them, to interrogate the nature of power, and to explore possibilities for resistance. In exploring the dynamics of power in and cultural contexts of these texts, the course explores the dystopian threats--and utopian possibilities--of a range of current political and cultural moments--not least our own. Prospective texts include: Utopia (More), 1984 (Orwell), The Parable of the Sower (Butler), and The Handmaid’s Tale (Atwood)."

The novel has long been linked to the rise of the individual as a literary focus, and this course examines the way in which these novels seek to articulate the complex inner lives of characters and explore the balance between desire and powerful economic and social pressures. We will consider the roles of changing norms for gender and sexuality and class mobility affect the trajectories imagined across plots that span the century.

Students taking the course for Spanish credits will also read the apocryphal second part of the novel by Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda to assess the societal impact the novel had on its audience in 1605.  Every student will read the English translation of Miguel de Unamuno's Our Lord Don Quixote to analyze the original novel in its historical context and examine the conclusions that 19th-century writers made regarding the story and the ""life"" of Don Quijote in light of the Spanish national identity crisis of the 1890s.  To complement the course, students taking the course will have the opportunity to participate in a journey through the ""route"" of Don Quijote (as described by Azorín in his 1905 novel) in Spain during the January intersession.  The class will be conducted in English."
LIT,221,"A study of the works of three of the greatest British writers, this course begins with an examination of the extraordinary variety and rich humanity of Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, then turns to a consideration of the grandeur and complexity of John Milton's vision in Paradise Lost and other poems, and finally moves on to an encounter with the fierce indignation and satiric genius of Jonathan Swift's  A Modest Proposal and Gulliver's Travels."

The course offers a grounding in the Irish Literary Revival of the early 20th century, a movement that was intimately connected with both literary modernism and Irish nationalism, and traces how debates about literature and ""Irishness"" continued to play out over the course of the century. Writers studied include Joyce, J.M. Synge, W.B.

Shelley’s claim that “Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world” and Emerson’s description of poets as “liberating gods” are among the better known expressions of this tradition. The poet is seen as one who possesses visionary insight into the hidden realities of the world, as well as one who argues for and helps bring about changes to the social order. This course provides students with an introduction to this tradition through the examination of three revolutionary and influential poetic voices, spanning the period from 1788 to the 1990s: William Blake, Walt Whitman, and Allen Ginsberg (Ginsberg, in fact, frequently pointed to Whitman and Blake as his literary ancestors). Taken together, they help reveal the nature and significance of the prophetic tradition in literature. No prerequisites."

The Merry Wives of Windsor, written in 1598, will be studied to determine what aesthetic concerns may have contributed to the profound shift in Shakespeare's work in little more than a year.  In Twelfth Night, the final play to be considered, special attention will be given to how the progression of plays written in 1599, culminating in Hamlet, led to Twelfth Night. By giving close readings to this specific group of Shakespeare's most recognized plays in the order in which they were written, students will have a rare opportunity to follow the evolution of  the Bard's protean imagination at a pivotal historical moment, which resulted in some of the greatest dramatic works in the English language.

Many of our finest writers attempted to capture the experience of the unruly and combustible 1960’s by dramatizing the quarrel we were having with ourselves, so that we might be able to see what we had become more clearly.  This course will examine novels, memoirs and personal essays that emerged, both, during and in the aftermath of this turbulent decade in our history. The writers will include E.L.

LIT,237,"The American West has long been associated with America’s sense of its national identity. Historians, politicians, artists, writers, and filmmakers have shaped a pervasive and complex national mythology from the history and geography of the lands west of the Mississippi (or, more exactly, west of the 100th meridian). Given its familiarity and attractiveness, this mythology often succeeds in obscuring the contradictory and problematic beliefs about American culture and history that it embodies. This course explores the nature of this mythology as it has been constructed in a number of paired literary and filmic works. Particular attention will be given to the evolving and often conflicting representations of the West and the Westerner (and their associated ideologies), and to the ways in which these works both create and subvert them. Studying these two genres should also lead to a greater awareness of the similarities and differences between literature and film when it comes to such narrative elements as character, setting, conflict, point of view, and theme. Paired films and fictions include the following: High Noon/“The Tin Star”; Stagecoach/“Stage To Lordsburg”; Shane; O Pioneers!; The Ox-Bow Incident; Winter in the Blood; Housekeeping; No Country For Old Men; and Brokeback Mountain. In addition, students will read a number of scholarly commentaries on western films and literary works that help to position these in relation to the main themes of the course."

In addition, students will read and respond to twelve other U.S. and U.K. poets, whose poems will be placed on electronic reserve, in order to provide themselves with a fuller picture of the wide range of poetries that have developed in each of these regions. Themes to be explored will include the uses of autobiography, the uses of nature, cultural history, gender, national identity, and evolutions in language and formal approaches. Through papers and a presentation, students will also hone their critical skills in reading and celebrating the richness of contemporary poetry in English throughout the world. No prerequisites."
LIT,240,"Between the Civil War and World War I, realism and naturalism emerged as the dominant modes of literary expression in America.  Influenced by such European writers as Zola, Balzac, Flaubert, and Dostoevski, American writers turned away from romanticism, insisting that the ordinary and the local were as suitable for artistic portrayal as the magnificant and the remote.  While the realists focused primarily on the motives and actions of ordinary men and women, the naturalists inclined toward greater frankness in their depiction of the downtrodden and abnormal and the deterministic forces of nature and chance.  The fiction of this period provides a dramatic historical and social portrait of America as it moved into the twentieth century.  Writers studied include W.D. Howells, Henry James, Stephen Crane, Mark Twain, Hamlin Garland, Jack London, Edith Wharton, Theodore Dreiser, and Frank Norris."
LIT,242,"In the writings of great philosophers of the Western world as well as in popular literature and cinema, Africa has long been cited as the epitome of what is base, brutal and corrupt in human nature.

LIT,244,"Walt Whitman's ""barbaric yawp"" and Emily Dickinson's oblique ""letter to the world"" constitute the two major voices of nineteenth century American poetry. Both suffered from a degree of neglect and misunderstanding in their lifetimes, but are now recognized as two of the most innovative and original poets ever to have written in the English language. Many regard them as the founders of modern American poetics. As writers they provide a fascinating study in contrasting styles of expression, one favoring elliptical brevity and variations on traditional metrical and musical forms, the other indulging in expansive free verse renderings of his experience of American life.  Their approaches to the world were just as different: one tended to limit herself and her writing to a narrow circle of family and friends, while the other engaged with public life and ambitiously sought critical recognition; one rarely published during her lifetime, while the other published the same book of poems multiple times, constantly revising and expanding it. This course studies their poetry in the context of their lives and the historical and intellectual milieu of the nineteenth century. No prerequisites."

This course examines a variety of literary works from the past two hundred years in an effort to better understand the different forms, meanings, and functions of the double as it appears in literature. Along the way, we will also examine various theoretical and critical approaches to the subject, such as those of Freud, Rank, Jung, Rogers, Keppler, Miller, and Webber.  Primary texts will be drawn from the following: Conrad, The Secret Sharer; Dostoevsky, The Double; Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance; Stevenson, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde; Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray; Williams, Descent into Hell; James, ""The Jolly Corner""; Hoffmann, ""The Sandman,"" ""The Golden Flower Pot."" ""Die Doppelganger""; Gogol, ""The Nose""; Poe, ""William Wilson,""  ""Ligeia,"" ""The Fall of the House of Usher""; Gilman, ""The Yellow Wallpaper""; Maupassant, ""The Horla""; Hogg, The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner; Macdonald, Phantastes."
LIT,249,"This course focuses on eight of Shakespeare’s plays in order to demonstrate how the power of the state is gained, enforced, undermined, and lost through the actions of individuals. One of the reasons for Shakespeare’s continued cultural presence throughout the world is that his plays speak to the political realities of the present.   No matter how power is exercised and abused globally, we can learn much from Shakespeare's dramatization of the public fate of nations through the personal motivations that drive human behavior. The goal of this course is to engage students in the political relevance of the themes in Shakespeare’s plays to the realities of the 21st Century, by experiencing the language of his plays as alive in the present. No prerequisites."
LIT,250,"An introduction to the narratives and imagery of the Bible, this course is designed to help students become familiar with this diverse and intricate text. As the most widely disseminated book in the world, and as the foundation for all three Abrahamic Religions, the Bible offers a window into these monotheistic world religions and the art inspired by them. This course will do a close reading of major portions of the Bible, consider its historical and anthropological contexts, its main characters, themes, and narratives, and its myriad and often conflicting visions. Students will produce a wide variety of analytic and creative responses - midrashim - to the readings."
LIT,251,"This course considers the history and development of Angels and of Satan in  three major religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Texts will include selections from the Tanak, the New Testament, the Apocrypha, the Koran, Interpreted, and the Kabbalah. We will explore themes such as the rhetoric of good and evil, the promise of salvation and damnation, the notion of faithfulness and sin, and the concepts of eschatology and apocalypticism. Further, we will read a variety of literary texts imbued with these themes in order to understand the
ways in which good and evil have been personified in literature.

LIT,252,"In proposing the concept of the ¿faithful thinker¿ in 1834, Ralph Waldo Emerson addressed what he believed to be the limitations of traditional science and religion as ways of understanding the world. Unfortunately, he never tried to develop the epistemological basis for his concept or found a way to put his theory into practice. Others, however, did. In his botanical studies, as well as his studies of light and color, the German writer and naturalist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe systematically developed a preliminary methodology of faithful thinking, which he called ¿exact sensorial imagination.¿  Indebted to both Goethe and Emerson, Henry David Thoreau¿s natural history writing illustrates the philosophic, literary, and scientific consequences of looking at the natural world with their ideas and methods in mind.  Finally, the work of the twentieth century English philosopher Owen Barfield articulates the historical and epistemological bases for faithful thinking and indicates various practical consequences stemming from its application to contemporary problems.  A study of their literary, philosophical, and scientific writings can add a new dimension to our understanding of Romanticism, both past and present. In addition to studying key works by these four writers, we will briefly look at some instances and explorations of ¿faithful thinking¿ among contemporary writers and scientists (e.g., Arthur Zajonc, Craig Holdredge, David Seamon, Henri Bortoft). "
LIT,253,"This course introduces students to writers for whom Christianity has been a source of literary inspiration and contestation. None of the writers approach Christianity dogmatically, but instead portray it as a religion raising difficult questions that rarely admit of simple answers.  Studying the various works should lead to a fuller understanding of the complexity, purpose, and meaning of human life as it's been portrayed within a variety of Christian literary contexts. Readings may include fiction by Madeleine L'Engle, Frederick Buechner, Mikhail Bulgakov, Graham Greene, C.S. Lewis, Flannery O'Connor, Shusaku Endo, George MacDonald, Fyodor Dostoevsky, T.S. Eliot, G.K. Chesterton, Walker Percy, or Charles Williams, as well as poetry by Dante, John Donne, George Herbert, William Blake, Gerard Manley Hopkins, and Emily Dickinson. Scholarly articles as well as authorial interviews will provide supplementary insights on the readings. The course does not assume or require any prior familiarity with Christian thought and tradition."
LIT,256,"The 19th century is recognized as the golden age of Russian literature, and the excellence of the fiction of that period is beyond dispute. The novels and short stories of the era are exquisitely crafted and are lyrical and exuberant, ironic and despairing by turns; they are full of the mystery and passion, the bitter complexities of human life. The survey will include works by Gogol, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Goncharov, Pushkin, and Chekhov."
LIT,257,"An intensive examination of writers, theories, and movements of 19th- and 20th-century drama. Authors, texts, and subjects differ each time the course is taught, and may include the works of writers such as Ibsen, Chekhov, Shaw, Strindberg, Pirandello, Lorca, O'Neill, Beckett, Brecht, Sartre, Genet, Ionesco, Pinter, Miller, Williams, Albee, Shepard, Mamet, and Stoppard."
LIT,258,"This course examines major works of realism and naturalism by 19th-century European and Russian novelists in their social and political contexts. Novels are selected from the works of writers such as Austen, Balzac, Conrad, Dickens, Dostoevsky, Eliot, Flaubert, Gogol, Stendhal, Tolstoy, Turgenev, Twain, and Zola. No prerequisites."
LIT,259,"This course offers a survey of modern and contemporary writing from Austria, Bosnia, Croatia, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Serbia. Students will read a variety of works from the pre- and post-World War II period. Readings include such prewar classics as Hasek's The Good Soldier Schweik, Kafka's short stories, Roth's The Radetsky March, and Schulz's The Street of Crocodiles; the work of Nobel Prize winners Czeslaw Milosz and Imre Kertesz; Tadeusz Borowski's harrowing tales of life and death in Auschwitz, This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen; Milan Kundera's novels of exile, disillusionment, and sexual comedy, such as The Book of Laughter and Forgetting; the plays and essays of Vaclav Havel, who went from dissident to president; and works by other writers such as Danilo Kis, Norman Manea, Ivan Klima, Bohumil Hrabal, Josef Skvorecky, Ingeborg Bachman, and Slavenka Drakulic. No prerequisites."
LIT,260,"In retrospect, some novels seem to both expand the form and define their moments and cultures - influencing writers who come after them while remaining inimitably themselves. This course will be devoted to close reading of four such landmarks, written in the second half of the twentieth century, which confront public, historical, and political issues, as well as exhibit the possibilities of the novel as a means to explore those issues and make them come alive for readers. Gunter Grass's The Tin Drum (1959) marked the beginning of postwar Germany's decades-long struggle to come to terms with its recent past, mixing history, fiction, and fantasy. Gabriel Garcia Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967) launched the ""Boom"" in Latin American writing and ""magic realism."" Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow (1973) is an epic novel about World War II that spoke eloquently and humorously of the paranoia and nightmares of the Cold War and the decades that followed. Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children (1981), inspired by Grass and The Tin Drum, brought its fractured version of the modern history of the Indian subcontinent to English letters, and was a harbinger of much postcolonial fiction. Through reading these novels and commentary about them, students will examine both the issues these works embody and the ways that they use fiction to broaden and deepen our understanding of the world and ourselves."
LIT,261,"Since the publication 50 years ago of ""Things Fall Apart,"" African writers have produced a range of novels and other works examining the continent's colonial legacy; its struggle for independence; the competing claims of tradition and modernity; the nature of the family; the presence of violence and conflict; and the relationship of the people, their countries, and continent to the West. The project of many of these writers has been to define (or redefine) Africa and its people on their own terms and in their own voice, after centuries in which both the land and its inhabitants were defined from without by writers as diverse as Joseph Conrad, Ernest Hemingway, Isak Dinesen, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and others. In this course, we will read novels, plays, poems, essays and other works -- including recent issues of literary magazines from the United States, Britain and Kenya -- in order to probe the current state of African writing and to examine the picture of Africa that emerges from the efforts of a broad array of its writers."
LIT,262,"This course will focus on religious traditions, particularly in America, Europe, and the Middle East. We will examine texts from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam for their artistic expression and for the ways in which they address issues of religious belief and experience. We will read the Torah and the Koran, interpreted in their entirety, and we will read selected parts of the Christian Bible. Further, we will examine classic and contemporary art and literature which spring from these primary sources, and we will write both creatively and theoretically about such themes as salvation, sin, creation, holy war, mysticism, law, and retribution."
LIT,263,"In recent years, the novelists of Latin America have been widely known and acclaimed. The best known is doubtless Nobel Laureate Gabriel García Márquez, but others, such as Mario Vargas Llosa, Carlos Fuentes, Julio Cortázar, Juan Rulfo, Alejo Carpentier, and Ernesto Sábato have established an important tradition in contemporary Latin American fiction. In this course, novels by these authors are read critically, with special attention given to the theme of cultural identity and to the historical and political reality of Latin America. (This course is also offered, using the texts in the original language, as Spanish 313 CP.)"
LIT,264,"This course examines various literary responses to the natural world, both as works of art and as expressions of different cultural beliefs and values (e.g., Buddhist, Zen Buddhist, Laguna Pueblo, Blackfeet, American Transcendentalist, Christian). Among the writers typically studied are Leslie Marmon Silko, James Welch, Matsuo Basho, William Shakespeare, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, William Faulkner, Annie Dillard, Peter Matthiessen, Margaret Atwood, and Mary Oliver. Students have the opportunity to do some of their own nature writing in addition to pursuing critical explorations of writers and issues. No prerequisites."
LIT,265,"This course will explore novels and short story collections published in the past 10 years. While the focus will be on students developing their own reading of each text, the class will also read reviews and criticism in order to examine how critical opinion forms around a book in the months and years after it is published. Writers considered in the class may include: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Deborah Eisenberg, Jonathan Saf ran Foer , Aleksandar Hemon, Uzodinma Iweala, Edward P. Jones, Cormac McCarthy, Ian McEwen, Alice Munro, Marilynne Robinson, Chris Ware, Colson Whitehead, and others. Students are required to read a novel a week. No prerequisites."
LIT,266,"Even though both modern African literatures in French and English started in the middle of the 20th century, their beginnings could not have been more different. Francophone literature  originated in France from theoretical and philosophical debates led by students from Africa and the Caribbean (Antilles), about colonialism and the place of the « Black man » in the world. Anglophone literature, on the contrary, started in Africa, « from  the ground up » so to speak,  with no preconceived ideology  and with novels instead of poetry.  In this course, we will look in detail at the history of these two literatures. We will discuss the notion of « négritude » and the controversies  surrounding it. We will also discuss the  impact of the Harlem Renaissance and  the sometimes heated debates  between  Francophone and Anglophone writers about what  « African » literature should be. No prerequisites."
LIT,268,"This course will examine developments in German literature following World War II. Topics to be considered will include the various ways that writers of the period dealt with the historical atrocities of the war itself, the issues attached to both the guilt and suffering of the Holocaust, the increased industrialization brought on by the German “economic miracle” of the 1950s, the separation and reunification
of the two Germanys, and the forwarding of philosophical and aesthetic approaches to poetry and the novel in the contemporary work of West Germany, East Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Writers discussed will include Günther Grass, Heinrich Böll, Ingeborg Bachmann, Paul Celan, Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Wolfgang Koeppen, Max Frisch, Thomas Bernhard, Christa Wolf, and Peter Handke."
LIT,270,"This course considers a diverse range of novels, short stories, poetry, essays, testimonials, and autobiography by Hispanic women writers of North America, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Questions of authority and resistance, gender and race, and class politics, as well as postcolonial issues, are discussed as they pertain to particular works. Readings include I, Rigoberta Menchu, by the 1992 Guatemalan Nobel Peace Prize winner; testimonials by women involved with the resistance movements in El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Argentina; feminist/antiracist works by Chicana activists Cherrie Moraga and Gloria Anzaldúa; novels by such writers as Cristina Garcia, Rosario Castellanos, Helena Viramontes, and others. We will also see a series of related films. Students will do
independent research on topics related to the readings, and will write up their findings in an extended inquiry log project. No prerequisites."
LIT,271,"This course will consider the relationship between psychoanalysis and the creative process. We will focus on global psychoanalytic theories of the expression of the human condition, starting with the foundations of Freudian theory and moving to a variety of thinkers including Fanon, Xie, Haraway, Nigiami, Irigaray, Said, and Zizek. In addition to these essential theorists, we will consider a wide variety of creative texts including fairy tales, dreams, personal narratives, literature, film, music, and visual and performing arts. Authors will include the Brothers Grimm, Shakespeare, Blake, Kafka, Hitchcock, Lahir, Poe, and Welty.
"
LIT,272,"This course will consider the idea of the individual in relation to the creative act. What is creativity? What is its source? How have we understood the creative object in its various forms: art, literature, love, religion? Starting with Freud's seminal essays, we will trace the movement of these ideas within critical and literary theory from the 20th century to the present. Topics will include dreams and fantasy, the uncanny, trauma, desire, humor, and post-humanism and cyber-culture. We will also read a variety of ""creative"" texts including works by Sappho, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Edgar Allen Poe, Philip K. Dick, Louise Erdrich, David Foster Wallace, Neil Gaiman, Grace Paley, and Mark Z. Danielewski. (Authors may change.) No prerequisites."
LIT,276,"Between the Civil War and World War I, realism and naturalism emerged as the dominant modes of literary expression in America.  Influenced by such European writers as Zola, Balzac, Flaubert, and Dostoevski, American writers turned away from romanticism, insisting that the ordinary and the local were as suitable for artistic portrayal as the magnificant and the remote.  While the realists focused primarily on the motives and actions of ordinary men and women, the naturalists inclined toward greater frankness in their depiction of the downtrodden and abnormal and the deterministic forces of nature and chance.  The fiction of this period provides a dramatic historical and social portrait of America as it moved into the twentieth century.  Writers studied include W.D. Howells, Henry James, Stephen Crane, Mark Twain, Hamlin Garland, Jack London, Edith Wharton, Theodore Dreiser, and Frank Norris."
LIT,279,"In the Americas the deep tradition of community storytelling has manifested
itself dramatically in recent, innovative narratives. These narratives
combine aspects of oral and written cultures, of native, ancient, and
contemporary stories, and question the suitability and credibility of the
written word even while they try to create new communities of readers.
Reading a selection of North American, South American, and Caribbean novels
in translation, this class aims to understand the at times critical, at
times hopeful messages of these unusual texts and other media. Primary
authors include Leslie Marmon Silko, Juan José Saer, Mario Vargas Llosa,
Robert Antoni, Ricardo Piglia, Patrick Chamoiseau and Subcomandante Marcos.
Secondary readings will investigate the historical, anthropological,
mythical, and political underpinnings of these stories and their complicated
relationship to self, tradition, and artistry."
LIT,280,"In her 1929 essay on female authorship, Virginia Woolf famously declared that “A woman must have money and a room of her own” in order to write. Historically, this level of independence has been difficult for women to obtain, and perhaps as a result the British literary canon has—from Chaucer to Shakespeare to Joyce—tended to be dominated by men. This course surveys the terrain of British literature before 1900 through the eyes of female authors, probing the dynamics of agency and authorship raised by women who were able to forge their own paths in the literary landscape. In doing so, we will trace the development of British literature from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, and up to the rise of the novel in the 19th century. Authors studied will include medieval mystic Julian of Norwich, Queen Elizabeth I, playwright and spy Aphra Behn, proto-feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, Jane Austen, and Charlotte Bronte."
LIT,281,"In his treatise On the Significance of Words, the Roman grammarian Pompeius Festus wrote: ""The sacred man is the one whom the people have judged on account of a crime. It is not permitted to sacrifice this man, yet he who kills him will not be condemned for homicide... This is why it is customary for a bad or impure man to be called sacred."" This literature course will consider the seeming contradiction implicit in the idea of Homo Sacer, the sacred one who is both lawless and somehow loved, condemned and revered. Using both theoretical and creative literary texts, we will explore the relationship between the law and the lawless.We will focus primarily on members of excluded communities, whose lives are expendable, and whose very existence solicits awe and wonder. We will ask - what does it mean to be Homo Sacer, expunged from society, exiled? What is the law? Who keeps laws and who breaks them? What is an enemy? How do friendships form? We will read theoretical texts including Giorgio Agamben's Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, and Jacques Derrida's The Politics of Friendship and Archive Fever. Further we will consider characters, both fictional and actual, who embody Homo Sacer. No prerequisites."
LIT,282,"Western literature begins with the epic poems of Homer, from which writers in all genres continued to draw for centuries. This class will introduce students to the epic genre, primarily through a careful reading of the earliest epics, Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Apollonius' tale of Jason and the Golden Fleece, and the Aeneid of Vergil. But we will also become familiar with Quintus of Smyrna, who tells of the Trojan Horse and the Fall of Troy (not contained in Homer's narrative), Lucan's poem on the Roman civil war, and Ovid's Metamorphoses, which taught Greek mythology to western Europe for centuries. We will investigate characteristics and literary techniques, and the oral composition of early epics. We will devote much time to the themes of epic. What is a hero and what are his goals? Are we necessarily meant to sympathize with the hero? What constitutes honor and virtue in epic? What general codes of conduct do these poems reflect? What is the role of the gods and what is man's relationship to them? Is violence a necessary element, and is it realistic? What role do women play? How were epics made to serve social and political purposes? No prerequisites."
LIT,286,"The drama of the Greeks has always been considered one of the highpoints of Western literature. We will investigate this drama primarily by reading--in English translation--and discussing many of the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles (but not the Oedipus plays read in Seminar), and Euripides, as well as the comedies of Aristophanes and the one which remains of the later poet Menander. We will consider theories concerning the origins of drama, in particular tragedy, and also the relationships among tragedy, comedy, and the mysterious satyr play. The major dramatists wrote in the 5th century in Athens, and an understanding of the conditions of production will provide insights into the plays. Such topics include: How and by whom were the plays chosen? Where and when were they performed, and who were the actors? What theatrical conventions existed and how did they help to determine what the playwright could do? What was the function of the chorus? Could Aristophanes really slander politicians and private citizens at will? How would an Athenian audience have reacted to the anti-war sentiments expressed during wartime constantly by Aristophanes and occasionally by Euripides (e.g., The Trojan Women)? I trust there will be sufficient thespian interest to allow us to act out, or even stage, individual scenes, and to test how one might embody different interpretations given the conventions and constraints. No prerequisites."
LIT,287,"This course offers students the opportunity to write in an informal style and personal voice about a wide range of topics. The personal essay typically combines elements of storytelling and description with reflective exploration. By locating the writer's personal experience within a larger context of ideas, the personal essay draws the reader into situations and settings that address questions of more universal relevance. Over the course of the term, students experiment with different ways of achieving the essay's mixture of rendering and reflection. Students produce some new writing every two weeks, both on assigned topics as well as ones of their own choosing, and must write and revise two extended essays during the course of the term. Class time is spent discussing students' writing and the work of published essayists, as well as occasionally engaging in informal writing activities. Prerequisite: Literature 150 or permission of the instructor."
LIT,288,"For students who have some experience in writing short fiction and want to give and receive helpful criticism in a workshop atmosphere, this course combines structure and freedom: structure in the form of assigned exercises drawing attention to the elements and techniques of fiction and freedom in the form of longer, independently conceived stories. Some time is spent each week discussing short fiction by contemporary writers as well as that of students in the workshop, with the goal of sharpening our abilities as writers, editors, and critics. Admission to the course is selective; candidates must submit samples of their writing to the
instructor before registration. Prerequisite: Literature 150 or permission of the instructor."
LIT,289,"The workshop is intended for students willing to make their own writing a means of learning about poetry, poetic devices, and techniques, and the discipline of making and revising works of art. Class time is divided between a consideration
of the students' work and the work of modern British and American poets, but the central concern of the course is the students' own writing, along with the articulation, both private and shared, of response to it. Prerequisite: Literature 150 or 151."
LIT,290,"This course is an overview of the influence of nondual philosophical and mystical traditions on twentieth century Slavic literature. From Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism to Kabbalah and Gnosticism, mystical traditions from around the world have been highly influential on Slavic fiction writers. Works such as Mikhail Bulgakov’s Master and Margarita, Bohumil Hrabal’s Too Loud a Solitude, Victor Pelevin’s The Life of Insects, and others will serve as a basis for writing and discussion of this mystical influence. In addition to the required readings by the authors listed below, this course will also include selected readings from secondary sources provided by the instructor on a number of nondual mystical traditions."
LIT,292,"In Shakespeare's plays, women appear as witches and lovers, servants and queens; men are warriors and villains, fathers and fools; male actors played female part - and female characters impersonate men. This course will explore how Shakespeare's plays relate gender to power through study of major texts reflecting his broad range of dramatic modes and the chronological span of his career. These dramas constantly remind us that the meaning of gender cannot be taken for granted, and the plots illuminate a complex array of intersections between gender and power, animated by issues such as performance, language, embodiment, violence, marriage, and inheritance. This course will explore this terrain in light of the broader cultural and literary context of early modern drama and a range of critical approaches in contemporary Shakespeare studies."
LIT,293,"In this media studies practicum, students will learn and practice basic news gathering and writing techniques as interviewing, sourcing, writing a lede and structuring a news or feature story, as well as basic editing, copy-editing and proofreading skills. We will also analyze the difference between objective and opinion-based reporting, and practice writing both types of stories.   Students will read widely in print journalism, both mainstream and alternative, and analyze others' work as well as produce their own articles, with possible publication in The Llama Ledger or other news media outlets a goal.  In addition to weekly shorter writing assignments, students will work towards the production of one substantial, polished article by the end of the class."
LIT,294,"In this modular course, we will discuss the political uses (and abuses) of alternative media formats such as blogs, zines and indie filmmaking, as well as delivery platforms such as You-Tube, Facebook and many others.  Have some media techniques that began as under-the-radar radical expressions of freedom of speech now been domesticated by the mainstream media? How far outside the box of big media does one have to go to find independent journalism--or is such a category even valid anymore? Where do bigtime ""alternative media"" platforms like Amy Goodman's ""Democracy Now!"" or The Rachel Maddow Show fit in? What is the role of the so-called alternative media today, and which media outlets are best at performing this role? Students will be asked to undertake an independent research project comparing and contrasting two media outlets--one mainstream, one alternative--or two alternative media formats¿a zine and a blog, for example, or a blog and a documentary film--in terms of (virtual) location, appearance, audience composition and impact, style and substance, and will present their findings in class as well as in a six-page final paper.  Other class requirements will include response journals and the creation of a zine for campus distribution and a blog with several substantive posts."
LIT,295,"In this introductory media studies practicum course, students will learn and practice basic reporting, writing and production techniques such as interviewing, sourcing, writing a lede, and structuring a news or feature story, as well as basic editing, copyediting and proofreading skills. We will analyze the difference between objective and opinion-based reporting, and practice writing both types of stories, for a variety of digital print platforms such as blogs and online newspapers or magazines, as well as radio scripts. We will read widely in the contemporary media, and discuss the history of the media in the U.S. and its current state today. Students will develop an e-portfolio of news and feature stories, with publication in the Simon’s Rock online student newspaper and production of a radio podcast a goal. A special feature of this course will be the opportunity to learn how to produce radio shows on news of interest to the local community for live broadcast, streaming and podcasting at the studios of WBCR-LP, Berkshire Community Radio."
LIT,296,"This course will focus on the art of playwriting with emphasis on dramatic structure, creating characters, developing conflict and advancing the action of a scene through dialogue. There will be assigned readings from highly regarded produced playwrights, exhibiting the dramatic elements that go into making an effective scene or one act play. The goal of the course is for students to become conversant enough in the various aspects of dramatic writing to progress toward the completion of a one act play. Prerequisites: completion of Sophomore Seminar."
LIT,297,"In this media studies practicum course, students will learn and practice basic news gathering and production techniques for a range of different delivery platforms, from digitized ""print"" format newspapers, radio podcasts, blogs and short video clips. Drawing on both print and online resources, we will explore the history of the media in the U.S. and its current state today, asking questions such as: What is the role of the so-called alternative media today, and which media outlets are best at performing this role?  What impact has the widespread use of social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. had on the business and practice of journalism, as well as on our political system? Assignments will include: a series of journalistic assignments keyed to specific formats; a multimedia research project; the start-up of a blog; and participation in a group video production project. Prerequisite: LIT295 or permission of the instructor."
LIT,303,"Dante’s Divine Comedy is one of the most influential works ever written and remains a major source of inspiration to writers and artists to this day. Along with a thorough reading of Dante’s epic poem, this course will consider modern and contemporary reworkings of his journey through Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise toward his beloved Beatrice. These will include Peter Greenaway’s 1989 A TV Dante, the 2010 film Dante’s Inferno: An Animated Epic, the 1911 Italian film L’Inferno, Gary Panter’s 2004 punk art graphic novel Jimbo in Purgatory, Seymour Chwast’s 2010 graphic novel Dante’s Divine Comedy: A Graphic Adaptation, Go Nagai’s 2004 anime Demon Lord Dante, Gustave Dore’s and Robert Rauschenberg’s illustrations of the Inferno, Seamus Heaney’s conjuration of a modern Irish pilgrimage, Station Island, and T.S.

We will then move on to trace this element, as well as Kafka's influence, in novels ranging across a number of cultures and eras of the last century. Works considered will include Samuel Beckett's Molloy and Malone Dies; H.G. Adler's The Journey ; Witold Gombrowicz's Ferdyduke ; J.M.

This course examines some of their major works: Poe's poetry, fiction, and literary theory; Hawthorne's tales and romances; and Melville's short stories and novels. In different ways, all three writers engage in a critique of American life and character that is sharply at odds with the more optimistic attitudes expressed by such contemporaries as Emerson, and Whitman.

LIT,307,"The 17th century, a period in which rampant licentiousness and immorality existed cheek by jowl with uncommon spirituality, is perhaps best epitomized by the complex career of John Donne. Donne made his mark as the master of the seduction poem, became a poet who celebrated married love, then a poet who wrote brilliantly of the dark night of the soul, and ultimately became dean of St. Paul's and one of England's greatest Anglican ministers. This course focuses on works that reveal the troubled soul of the age, from the frivolous, sometimes nihilistic, verse of the cavaliers and the dark and tortured dramas of John Webster and Ben Jonson, to the calm spiritual intensity of George Herbert and John Milton.

Immediately, you are with the embittered, cerebral adolescent, Stephen Daedalus on a tower overlooking the rocky coast of Ireland, watching your pompous, smug but clever roommate shave his fat cheeks.  ""I will not sleep here tonight,"" Stephen decides resentfully and sets out on a pilgrimage that will take him through 800 pages and many of Dublin's by-ways, but only one day.  That day, June 16, 1904, has become known as Bloomsday in honor of the novel's other hero (or anti-hero), Leopold Bloom.  This quizzical, caring character whose path crosses Stephen's throughout that day is one of the fullest and most appealing characters in all of literature.  By creating him and exploring his inner life, Joyce, who can seem callously ironic and intimidating, demonstrates his own humanity.

Ulysses has been called ""the most difficult of entertaining books and the most entertaining of difficult books.""  It is the ideal work to study in a seminar:  hard to get through on one's own, but rewarding to theoretical analysis.  No work teaches more about the human mind and the way it can be illuminated by literature.  In reading it, we learn about popular song, Irish history, Greek mythology, Shakespeare's unfaithful wife, geometry, and what the end of the world has to say for itself.  This course is designed to help interested students cope with Ulysses’ difficulty and learn to enjoy its jokes, its music, its magic.

LIT,310,"When we think of Modern Poetry, names like T.S. Eliot, W.B.Yeats, Wallace Stevens, Gertrud Stein, and Ezra Pound immediately come to mind. However, literary movements are not forged by just a handful of writers, nor do all writers in a given era think and write alike. That is to say, some modernists did not know they were modernists, others did claim the moniker, and still others were working simultaneously in entirely different, but important ways. Hence, alongside a consideration of iconic Modernists, we will also consider poems of lesser-known poets, such as Jean Toomer, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Mina Loy, Lorine Niedecker, and D.H. Lawrence, as well as better-known writers such as Robert Frost, Thomas Hardy, William Carlos Williams, Hart Crane, and Langston Hughes, who countered or adapted modernist poetic techniques in ways that may not seem modern, but were nevertheless part of the times. The roles of convention and innovation in modern verse will also be explored, as will the philosophies and poetics manifest in the work of the poets chosen for study. Students will write three critical papers on poets and poems of their own choosing, as well as do a critical presentation on one of the poets in class. Prerequisite: 100-level Literature class or permission of the instructor."
LIT,311,"This course is a detailed examination of the literature of American modernism in its intellectual and historical contexts. Students read Pound's Hugh Selwyn Mauberly, Eliot's The Waste Land, Stein's Three Lives, Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, Hemingway's In Our Time, Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, and Toomer's Cane. They also study selected poems by Cullen, Cummings, Eliot, Frost, H.D. Hughes, Masters, McKay, Moore, Pound, Sandburg, Stevens, W.C. 
Williams, and others. Topics discussed include the movements (imagism, vorticism, symbolism, cubism, futurism, the Harlem Renaissance), the attitudes (the postwar temper, the revolt against the village), the tenets (the tradition of the
new, the impersonality of poetry, the avant-garde role of the artist), the centers (Chicago, Paris, London, New York), and the little magazines and papers (Poetry, Little Review, Blast, Others, The Crisis) that helped to define and shape the writing
of the period."
LIT,316,"In the more than sixty books he published between 1959 and his death in 2009, John Updike established himself as one of the most important American writers of the second half of the 20th century.  This course will focus on intensive examination of many of his short stories and on the four novels he wrote about Harry ""Rabbit"" Angstrom over the course of his career.  Texts will include The Early Stories, The Complete Henry Bech, Licks of Love, the four Rabbit novels, and the novella ""Rabbit Remembered.""

LIT,318,"This course examines modern and contemporary writing from countries known from 1945-1989 as Eastern Europe- Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Rumania, and Yugoslavia.  As these countries split apart and redefine themselves, becoming known again (as they were before World War II) as Central Europe, students will read some of the diverse body of literary works their writers have produced in the pre- and post-World War II period.  Readings include such prewar classics as Hasek's The Good Soldier Schweik, Schulz's The Street of Crocodiles, and the stories of Franz Kafka; the poetry and essays of Nobel Prize winner Czeslaw Milosz; Tadeusz Borowski's harrowing tales of life and death in Auschwitz, This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen; Milan Kundera's novels of exile, disillusionment, and sexual comedy, such as The Book of Laughter and Forgetting; the plays and essays of Vaclav Havel, who went from jailed dissident to president of Czechoslovakia; and works by other writers.  Students are expected to read a book a week."
LIT,319,"This seminar offers an intensive examination of major writers whose work shaped and embodied one of the most important movements in 20th-century drama. The focus will be on close reading of a number of plays by four or five authors in their literary, cultural, and philosophical contexts. Writers and texts will vary each time the course is taught and may include Pirandello, Cocteau, Beckett, Camus, Sartre, Genet, Ionesco, Pinter, Albee, Havel, Mrozek, and Stoppard.

beginning with Structuralism and concluding with Postmodernism. Texts include works by Saussure, Jakobson, Foucault, Kristeva, and Derrida. Each student's research project involves a presentation to the class and a term paper. Prerequisite: One 200-level literature course or permission of the instructor."
LIT,322,"Hermeneutics can be understood as the art of interpretation of sacred scripture. What is the meaning of a text? How can that meaning be illuminated? What is the author's intent? What are the questions one must ask when the author is divine? This course will center on the Pentateuch: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. These five books offer richly textured and intricately woven motifs, powerful inner structures of sound, echoes, allusions, repetitions, and complex narrative and rhetorical force. Further, ideas of primeval history, patriarchy, deliverance, law, sacrifice, ritual, holiness, rebellion, and the covenant find their home here. Over the last 20 years there has been an explosion of literary study of the Hebrew Bible, and we will do both a close reading of the text and an examination of some of the theoretical issues that are fundamental to it. We will read secondary literature by biblical scholars such as Harold Bloom, Leslie Brisman, Martin Buber, Mary Douglas, Everett Fox, Joel Rosenberg, and Gershom Scholem, and by creative writers such as Isaac Bashevis Singer, Bernard Malamud, John Milton, and William Blake.

LIT,323,"As a journalist, playwright, philosopher, and novelist, Albert Camus was one of the best-known and most widely discussed writers of the second half of the 20th century.  Born, raised, and educated in colonial Algeria, he became one of the most important French writers of the twentieth century.  During the Nazi occupation of France, the publication of his novel The Stranger and his philosophical essay The Myth of Sisyphus caused a sensation and led him to be linked with Jean Paul Sartre as one of the voices of existentialism.  When it became known after the Occupation that their author was also the editor of the Resistance newspaper Combat, his moral and political stature was even further enhanced.  For a while, he was both a celebrity and an intellectual hero—and not just in France.  By the time he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957 and died in a car accident in 1960, however, he had become isolated in France—mocked and dismissed by Sartre and his circle, and a pariah to both Left and Right because of his opposition to both communism and Western imperialism and because of his position on the Algerian War.  Although his most important works have never been out of print and have consistently been international best sellers for sixty years, his critical reputation has undergone radical shifts. With the recent publication for the first time of English translations of a number of his major works—Notebooks 1951-1959, Camus at Combat—Writing 1944-1947, and Algerian Chronicles—more of his work is available to the English reader than ever before. This course will intensively examine his career, ideas, and work through close readings of his novels—The Stranger, The Plague, The Fall, and the posthumously published The Last Man, The Myth of Sisyphus, his four plays, and selections from his personal and political essays.  Prerequisite: Sophomore standing and completion of a 200-level literature course, or permission of the instructor."
LIT,324,"This course explores literary works and the ways in which they have been interpreted, adapted, and reimagined in later centuries by a range of writers and filmmakers. While each work is examined on its own, we will also look at the ways in which the works together illuminate both the source text and the counterpart, offering opportunities to examine the times and the cultures that produced each. The source texts will be canonical English works; the counterparts demonstrate how this act of transformation occurs across eras and cultures. The course examines different ways that this transformation is enacted, with pairings that turn the tables on the relationship of protagonist to antagonist, that explore inventive adaptations, or that suggest connections that are more associative or intuitive. Critical readings include works on literary influence, intertextuality, and narrative theory. Texts include Beowulf, Sir Gawain & The Green Knight, King Lear, Robinson Crusoe, Jane Eyre and later works by John Gardner, Akira Kurosawa, J.M. Coetzee, Jean Rhys, and others."
LIT,325,"Walter Benjamin is considered one of the most influential literary and cultural critics of the twentieth century.

LIT,326,"This course explores early modern (15th-17th century) English literature with a particular focus on how it engages, illuminates, and problematizes questions of embodiment. In texts from this period, the body emerges as a site of critical and creative fascination--a locus of medical and magical thought, a political metaphor, and an emblem of diverse developing literary forms. This course probes that complex interplay, analyzing historical and theoretical constructions of embodiment and taking them as lenses through which to engage a range of texts from the English literary renaissance. As course texts demonstrate, the body is an insistently compelling form, at once metaphorical and material, insistently changeable, and a source of both power and vulnerability. Prospective texts include: Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Spenser's The Faerie Queen, Golding's translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses, Shakespeare's King Lear, Webster's The Duchess of Malfi, and poetry by Sir Philip Sidney and John Donne.

LIT,328,"This course examines the formation, nature, and critiques of American middle-class identity from the eighteenth century to the present.  Co-taught by a professor of literature and an historian, the course draws extensively on both literary and historical materials.  Topics of study include the emergence of middle-class mores and material culture, the ways that changes in work and leisure affected class identity, and contemporary debates over membership in the middle class. We examine how gender, race, and region inflected class status and identification and also consider historical critiques of the middle class from both 'above' and 'below.'

Though their writing is not part of the mainstream of modern British fiction, it is increasingly being recognized for its significant contributions to contemporary Christian thought and literary expression. This course focuses on their lives, their relationships with one another, their religious beliefs, and such major works as Lewis's deep space trilogy and mythopoeic fantasies, Williams's novels of theology and the supernatural, Tolkien's Rings Trilogy, and Barfield's studies of language and consciousness.

This phenomenon, known as the Latin American Boom, continues to affect publishing, writing, and reading past the turn of the century.  Topics include the Cuban Revolution, Magical Realism, the New Narrative, and the growth of the media.

Through close readings of the selected texts, both written and filmed, and through reading and discussion of scholarly writings on the study of narrative, students will develop a deep understanding of the formal strengths of each medium. The comparative study of literature and film provides the opportunity for students to explore for themselves the process of adapting complex prose to the screen. Such works as Howards End, Strangers on a Train, The English Patient, The Sheltering Sky, and No Country for Old Men are discussed."
LIT,387,"This course offers students the opportunity to write in an informal style and personal voice about a wide range of topics. The personal essay typically combines elements of storytelling and description with reflective exploration.

Over the course of the term, students experiment with different ways of achieving the essay's mixture of rendering and reflection. Students produce some new writing every two weeks, both on assigned topics as well as ones of their own choosing, and must write and revise two extended essays during the course of the term.

LIT,394,"In the Middle Ages, confession was referred  to as the ""Queen of Proofs"" for its presumed authenticity. The cultural scripts that emerged in legal and religious realms of that time remain familiar conventions, shaping our understanding of what it means to tell stories or expose secrets. This course will pursue questions of subjectivity, agency, truth, and guilt raised by rituals of confession that have long propelled literary works. This course will examine how the discourse of confession shapes subjectivity in modern literature and cultural studies, exploring this critical question in legal, religious, and domestic contexts. Drawing on the work of theorists including Michel Foucault, J. L. Austin, and Eve Sedgwick, we will trace the complexities of confessional modes in texts ranging from early modern drama (Shakespeare's Othello and Ford's 'Tis Pity She's a Whore) to twentieth-century prose (Camus's The Fall and Atwood's Alias Grace) to modern film (Hitchcock's I Confess and Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty)."

LIT,03A,"Within this course, we will read literature in its many forms, from short stories to poetry and from drama to the novel and non-fiction.  As we encounter different types of texts, we will consider all the things that literature can (and possibly should) do as well as gain an understanding of the limits and possibilities of each generic form.  We will encounter these texts as readers and critics, both engaging the texts for the pleasure of reading but also to uncover their many dimensions of meaning.

LIT,218M,"One of the many remarkable things about Shakespeare as a playwright is his range—over the course of his career, he excelled across genres, and his greatest hits span tragedy, comedy, history, and romance. This mod focuses in particular on perhaps the first genre that Shakespeare tackled: comedy. We will explore how his plays blend humor and pathos as they navigate—and problematize—the genre. With their emphasis on romance and marriage, identity and disguise, and social disorder, Shakespeare’s comedies raise questions of gender, agency, and politics that we will probe throughout the course. In our analyses, we will approach the plays as both literary texts and texts for performance. Prospective texts include Comedy of Errors, Much Ado About Nothing, Twelfth Night, and All’s Well That Ends Well.

Because the texts under consideration have literary underpinnings, the writings offer aesthetic glimpses -- at times personal, journalistic, or scientific -- into the very human experiences of illness, suffering, healing, life and death. Our overarching goal will be to encourage a cross-disciplinary dialogue between humanistic knowledge and scientific observation that considers writing’s usefulness in confronting illness and medicine.

How does digital storytelling fit into the larger, international history of storytelling? In addition to an exploration of these questions, students will learn to effectively communicate through multimedia modalities. No prerequisites."
LR,110M,"In this course, we will consider the intersection of information and technology, a space where so much of our time is spent in pursuit of academic and personal interests. The course will address such questions as:  How do we break down the undifferentiated mass of ‘information’ that confronts each of us every time we open a browser?  Do we understand the implications of technologies that use information gathered about us and our activities? How can we become information creators and not just consumers? What are our rights and responsibilities as citizens not just of a nation, but of virtual space as well? As part of the investigation of these and other questions, students will use digital tools to collect, curate, critique, and construct multimedia, information-based units that can be integrated into their academic work more broadly. No prerequisities.

LR,112M,"We are inundated with images every day: from photographs to film stills, advertisements, memes, political cartoons, and so much more. We also create our own images, adding to the proliferation of visual media. We see them all, but how much attention do we give to what they are really telling us? Visual literacy involves ""reading"" an image, interpreting and deriving meaning from it, as well as using it for communication. This course will hone students' visual literacy skills through the close reading of images, sourcing and using them ethically, and repurposing them within different contexts. Relevant copyright issues will be explored. We will also examine how the proliferation of images in our media-saturated culture is affecting our relationship with information creation and consumption. No prerequisites.

"
LR,114M,"Drawing on sources from across the print and digital realm, students will engage with the food media landscape, understanding the role information literacy plays in consumption--of both food and information. This course examines the intersection of information and food. What are the social constructs around food that are created or perpetuated by the food industry, government, and media? How has technology changed our access to culinary and nutrition information, and what decisions do we make based on this knowledge?

LR,122M,"Information is power. Access to information is vital to participation in work, society, and civil life. The instantaneity and burgeoning growth of the internet may be leading to a false perception of democratization and equality of access which permits information privilege to be largely ignored. This course examines a range of factors that can limit information access - from a baseline of internet availability to geography, economics, education, race, ethnicity, age, ability, and more. The result is a digital divide, where those with fewer information resources are sidelined. Also considered are movements to bridge these gaps, many undertaken by libraries and academics, assessing their impact on equitable information access. No prerequisites."
LR,125M,"From its antecedents in Mesopotamian clay tablets through to its subsumption into the digital environment, the book has served as one of the first and most enduring information technologies. In this course, students trace the history of the book as a physical object, investigating developments in page medium, text inscription, and final assembly. Students also consider the effects and implications of such physical changes on writing, reading, knowledge, and education. Alongside considering the book-as-object, we also explore the book-as-subject and -as-symbol: what constitutes a ""book""? How have human orientations toward and engagements with texts varied over time and throughout culture? What connections can we draw across those temporal and cultural boundaries? Will the book ever die? As a final project, students bring some of these considerations to bear on their own creation of a physical book.

Theory II introduces the use of dissonance in the form of suspension and seventh chords, and chromaticism in the form of secondary harmonies and modulatory progressions. Chromatic harmonies (Neapolitan and augmented sixth chords) and enharmonic relations complete the tonal picture. Short whole pieces from the Baroque period are used as first examples of whole-piece analysis. Prerequisites: Intermediate music-reading ability and permission of the instructor."

MUS,214,"Emphasizing listening and the development of individual responses, this course explores the work of two pivotal figures in late 18th-century music, one of whom changed the direction of European music decisively toward instrumental forms (sonata, quartet, symphony), while the other mastered these forms with astonishing speed and also brought the older form of opera to its historical pinnacle. Individual works are examined in depth but with attention to the larger historical context. Student work includes response journals and one paper/project on a self-selected topic. Either an acquaintance with musical notation or some historical or literary background are suggested but not required."
MUS,215,"A continuation of Music 214m that can also be taken separately, this module explores the outcome of 18th-century developments in the early 19th century through the works of two contrasting figures, Beethoven (1770-1827), a composer
of concert music who worked in the public eye, and Schubert (1797-1828), whose most successful works were meant for homes and salons, and whose moment of fame arrived several generations after his death. Both composers' innovations were built on the solid foundations of the classical forms and classical tonality, but each created a highly personal style. Individual works are examined in depth but with attention to the larger historical context. Student work includes response journals and one paper/project on a self-selected topic. Either an acquaintance with musical notation or some historical or literary background are suggested but not required."
MUS,216,"Music developing in post-revolutionary Europe was influenced by both Napoleonic artistic politics and the rising middle class; it reflected a new flexibility of social class and social roles. It courted and sometimes won the mass public with a style that alternated erratically between the intimate, privileged space of the visionary and the inflated rhetoric of the virtuoso. Good taste and good marketing jockeyed for position; the outcome can be seen in the overwhelming influence of Wagner, affecting those who reacted against him even more than those who set out to follow him. All students are encouraged to love or hate any of the music we study as long as they have fun doing so and saying so. Prerequisite: Some music reading ability."
MUS,217,"This course invites students to treat music written in the 20th century as an open text and to write their own histories of it based on their perceptual and aesthetic interactions with a wide variety of musical gestures, while considering the views of such writers as Adorno, Benjamin, McLeary, Nattiez, and Attali. The class focuses especially on the ""loose canon"" of early 20th-century masters, particularly exploring the values influencing the continual reassessment of the works of Schoenberg. The issue of relationship to audience is investigated. The class views videos of modern operas and attends a concert in New York or Boston. Students do listening/reading assignments and three self-generated investigations (paper/projects). Some music-reading ability is recommended."

NATS,209,"Do you have a dataset you want to analyze thoroughly, methodically and in a sophisticated and rigorous manner? No matter which of the life, social and physical sciences this dataset or your interests represent (e.g., psychology, computer science, applied mathematics, earth sciences, economics, biology, ecology), this course will teach you how to perform those analyses. This course is an excellent preparation for most research projects, in particular a senior thesis, as well as the Columbia 3-2 program.  The course addresses many of the most often applied methods of data analysis. Since the basic unit of analysis is a real, rectangular matrix of data, the first part of the class will simultaneously introduce the problem of data reduction and preferred coordinate systems, and build the linear-algebraic tools needed to analyze such multi-dimensional datasets. We will first introduce diagonalization of square matrices as a generalization of the real numbers, and discuss the stability of diagonalization under perturbations and uncertainty.We will next introduce square covariance matrices, and discuss their structure, meaning, and limits of determination. We will then combine both parts by bringing to bear the analysis methods developed earlier on the analysis of square covariance matrices.  Rectangular cross-covariance matrices of several datasets, and their decomposition, will be introduced, derived and discussed next. This will naturally lead to some basics of filtering and  truncation. Reconstruction methods and their limitations will conclude the course.  Preqs: Calculus I or Introduction to Statistics. Because this course will  be as self-contained as realistically possible, linear algebra is not required."

PHIL,103,"This course focuses on doctrines common to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam: That there is one, powerful, just God who created the universe, who has revealed himself to his creatures, and who requires certain conduct of them. We explore various questions raised by these doctrines,  including: Can God's existence be reconciled with the existence of evil? Is there compelling evidence for God's existence? Should the believer in God have evidence for the existence of God? Should the believer in God not have evidence for the existence of God? What is the connection between religion and morality? Religion and science? Do we, or could we, have any evidence for the existence of miracles? Is there an afterlife? Is an afterlife desirable?"
PHIL,105,"This course serves as an introduction to some of the main issues in western philosophy.  Emphasis is placed on analytical thinking, speaking, and writing.  Issues to be addressed include: external-world skepticism, the existence of God, determinism and free will, personal identity, the objectivity of morality, and the nature of science.  No prerequisites."
PHIL,113,"Formal logic, also known as symbolic logic, involves the formalization of the logical rules implicit in human reasoning. Its goal is to determine which forms of argument must produce true conclusions when applied to true premises. Studying formal logic is a good way to become familiar with the logical structure of sentences and arguments in natural languages. This in turn is useful in many contexts. We will study the translation of sentences from natural languages into formal languages and vice versa; the truth-functional operators (`and', `or', `not'), the conditional (`if...then...'), and the biconditional (`if and only if'); propositional logic, which evaluates arguments containing the truth-functional operators; predicate logic, which adds to propositional logic rules concerning the quantifiers `all' and `some'; proofs of the consistency and completeness of propositional and predicate logic; and modal logic (the logic of possibility and necessity). Grades will be assigned on the basis of exams, quizzes, and homework assignments. Background in logic or mathematics is helpful but not required."
PHIL,129,"The Christian New Testament is a small group of works with profound historical, theological, and ethical implications generated in part by the many tensions they contain. These works attribute universal and eternal significance to the life, teachings, and death of a peasant in an obscure backwater of the Roman Empire; they reflect a deep-seated Judaism at the same time that they have led to the most vicious anti-Jewish oppression in history; they contain distinct and perhaps disparate messages from the two central figures, Jesus and Paul; they counsel a moral focus on the kingdom of God while containing decidedly political messages -- and having been themselves written, redacted, and collected as a result of intensely political processes. In this course, we explore the New Testament by means of a variety of methods: contextualization within the Hellenistic world and within Judaism of late antiquity; analysis of primary texts through comparison to similar texts in the New Testament, the Hebrew Bible, and noncanonical works; and reflection on the theological dimensions of the texts. Prerequisite: Seminar I (FS100)."
PHIL,175,"In this class, we will examine foundational questions in ethics. We will discuss the objectivity of morality, the nature of well-being, and the rules that govern right conduct. Is there an objective fact about right and wrong, or is morality relative to persons or cultures? What is it to live a good life? What rules--if any--determine what is right or wrong? How should we make moral decisions? Three applications of ethical theory will help guide our discussion: our duties to the less fortunate, ethical vegetarianism, and the value of the environment. Grades will be assigned on the basis of papers, exams, and class participation. No prerequisites."
PHIL,177,"Some of the most contentious debates in public morality today arise in the context of the practice of medicine and medical research. Many of these debates are the result of continuously advancing medical technologies that challenge our conception of what it is to be a human being and force us to consider the relation between our conceptions of ourselves as biological beings and as moral beings. We
shall thus study the ethics of cloning, genetic engineering, stem cell research, and various reproductive technologies and strategies, including abortion, IVF, and surrogate motherhood. In addition, because they are faced with life and death decisions on an almost daily basis, healthcare professionals are frequently faced with moral dilemmas that have an urgency rarely found in other areas of human
activity. It is with this urgency in mind that we shall examine the ethical guidelines that might be established for such end-of-life decisions as advanced directives, DNR orders, euthanasia, and physician-assisted suicide. Finally, because the accessibility and delivery of healthcare is increasingly associated with current notions of justice, we shall examine the ethical issues surrounding the distribution
of resources and managed care, as well as associated issues involving the physician-patient relationship. The course will consider the differences in how these various issues are approached from competing ethical perspectives, including consequentialism, Kantian deontology, and virtue ethics, and special attention will be paid to whether and how the principle of double effect may be invoked to resolve some of these moral dilemmas. Prerequisite: One course in social studies or one course in biology."
PHIL,203,"This course focuses on doctrines common to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam: that there is one, powerful, just God who created the universe, who has revealed himself to his creatures, and who requires certain conduct of them. We explore various questions raised by these doctrines, including: Can God's existence be reconciled with the existence of evil? Is there compelling evidence for God's existence? Should the believer in God have evidence for the existence of God? Should the believer in God not have evidence for the existence of God? What is the connection between religion and morality? Religion and science? Do we, or could we, have any evidence for the existence of miracles? Is there an afterlife? Is an afterlife desirable?"
PHIL,206,"This course examines the historical roots and modern practice of the religious and philosophical traditions of China, Japan, and Korea. First we start in northeast India in the 6th century B.C., examining Vedic traditions and the historical development and diffusion of Buddhism. Before tracing the spread of Buddhism to East Asia, we study the development of Daoism, Confucianism, and Shinto, and the cultural traditions with which they coevolved. The next phase of the course focuses on the coexistence of these philosophies and religions, changes in their collective and individual roles within society, and their integration into the visual
arts, music, literature, martial arts, daily life, and cultural landscapes. In the final phase of the course, we examine the roles that these belief systems play in contemporary East Asian and North American culture. Guest speakers discuss
their own experiences and practices. Students are encouraged (but not expected) to observe or participate in activities at local Buddhist and Daoist communities. Students are also encouraged to relate their own experiences and practices to the course."
PHIL,207,"Daoism has had a major impact on Chinese intellectual and spiritual life for over two millennia. A philosophy that emphasizes individual development, immersion in nature, the rejection of societal convention, and the cultivation of natural virtue, it has been embraced by scholars, painters, poets, and political thinkers. A religion derived from classical philosophy, folk practices, Buddhism, and Yogic
techniques, it perseveres in village rituals, global popular culture, and dissident sects like China's Falungong. Taijiquan is a Daoist system of moving meditation and a martial art based on slowly flowing and subtly configured motions. Practiced worldwide, it is ""the dance of Daoism,"" providing insight and personal experience of Daoist principles found in major texts like the Dao De Jing, Zhuangzi, and Liezi. This course provides students with the opportunity to read classical texts on Daoism and Taijiquan and to study the Thirteen Postures, a Yang style form of Taijiquan. We also read Daoist nature poetry, Tang dynasty Daoist short stories, and an account of the life of Guan Saihong, a Daoist master (and if possible, we will have Guan visit the class). Our practice of Taijiquan and work on textual interpretation is supplemented with free-ranging discussions (talks) on Daoism in the spirit of the School of Pure Conversation, a Daoist group of the first millennium that emphasized free expression and a sharpening of the imagination. No prerequisites."
PHIL,208,"This course will examine Buddhist experience and expression in its diversity and regional variation encompassing forms found in South, Southeast, Central, and East Asia. This is in an interdisciplinary study that uses a combination of primary Buddhist texts in translation and selections from the secondary literature on Buddhism, film, and other media. We will trace the major threads of Buddhist thought, practices, and history while paying special attention to the ways in which this Indian religion adapted to a wide range of cultures in Asia and now in the West."
PHIL,212,"What is the mind? Is it a kind of independent immaterial substance, or is it merely a property or effect of the brain, in the way that light is a property or effect of a lightbulb? Or is what we call mind really just a naive way of talking about the neurological processes within the brain? Can the whole of our conscious life, our cognitive, emotional, and moral experience, be reduced to complex chemical processes within the brain? This course will consider such questions as these, and explore how we think about the mind, what it is, how it is related to the body and brain, and whether, how, and to what extent mind is comparable to a computer. While our discussions will be informed by current research in psychology and cognitive neuroscience, we shall proceed primarily by means of conceptual and descriptive analysis, drawing from classic and contemporary readings in both the analytic and phenomenological traditions. The course will also consider several closely related problems, including personal identity and freedom of the will, and we seek to gain a better understanding of the mind and its relation to the world. Prerequisite: Sophomore standing or permission of instructor."
PHIL,213,"Formal logic, also known as symbolic logic, involves the formalization of the logical rules implicit in human reasoning. Its goal is to determine which forms of argument must produce true conclusions when applied to true premises. Studying formal logic is a good way to become familiar with the logical structure of sentences and arguments in natural languages. This in turn is useful in many contexts. We will study the translation of sentences from natural languages into formal languages and vice versa; the truth-functional operators (`and', `or', `not'), the conditional (`if...then...'), and the biconditional (`if and only if'); propositional logic, which evaluates arguments containing the truth-functional operators; predicate logic, which adds to propositional logic rules concerning the quantifiers `all' and `some'; proofs of the consistency and completeness of propositional and predicate logic; and modal logic (the logic of possibility and necessity).

PHIL,215,"Can we know that God exists? That neutrons exist? That each other exists? That Simon's Rock exists? To answer these questions, we must first know what knowledge is. Epistemology is the study of knowledge and related notions such as justification, belief, and evidence. In this course, we will examine central questions in epistemology by examining primary texts, both historical and contemporary. We will study both traditional epistemology (which considers belief, disbelief, and agnosticism) and probabilistic epistemology (which takes belief to be a matter of degree). Topics will include: skepticism; the nature of knowledge; the nature of justification; the relationship between knowledge and justification; feminist epistemology; a priori knowledge; peer disagreement; self-locating beliefs; and applications of epistemological principles to puzzling and paradoxical situations, including Sleeping Beauty, Doomsday, Reflection, the Lottery Paradox, and the Cable Guy Paradox. Prerequisite: one class in social studies or permission of the instructor."
PHIL,216,"In this course, we will examine a number of issues that arise from philosophical reflection on the practice of science. These include: The nature of scientific theory change; the role that values play in scientific inquiry; the relationship between observation and theory; the confirmation of scientific theories; the nature of scientific explanation and natural laws; the debates between scientific realism and antirealism; and the distinction between science and pseudoscience. Prerequisite: Sophomore Seminar, and one 200-level class in social studies, science, or mathematics or permission of the instructor."
PHIL,217,"Immanuel Kant and David Hume are among the most influential philosophers of the last 300 years.  Kant famously argues that the human mind cannot be considered a mere passive observer, but must instead be understood to be an active participant in structuring its knowledge of the world.  Among the surprising positions that Kant argues for in his metaphysical works is the ideality or the subjective origin of space, time, and causality.  His moral philosophy seeks to establish analogously a principle of morality that is at once subjective in origin yet objectively valid.  While Kant must be considered a revolutionary thinker in the history of modern philosophy, his work needs to be understood largely as a response to the skepticism of David Hume.  Like Kant, Hume was interested in placing strict limits upon what it is that human beings can claim to know.  However, the skeptical arguments by which he achieves these limits, especially his attacks on the notion of causality and the inductive method, have the effect of apparently undermining the knowledge claims of physicists just as much as of the metaphysicians.  We shall be interested in evaluating his arguments and determining how much of either science Kant is able to recover..  In this context, the course will also consider Hume’s predecessor’s within the tradition of British Empiricism, especially Locke and Berkeley, who in many respects provide the foundation both for Hume’s skepticism and Kant’s critical philosophy.  Finally, we shall examine Hume’s emotivist anti-rationalism in ethics as a sharp contrast to the rationalism of Kant’s moral philosophy.

The course will involve the close reading of several seminal works in the history of philosophy, and there will be some emphasis especially on acquiring a precise understanding of Kant’s positions and arguments.  While we shall always remain sensitive to the historical context of when these works were written, the class will consider the problems that were of concern to Hume and Kant as if engaging contemporary philosophers in dialogue over these issues.
"
PHIL,218,"Can we know anything beyond the existence of our own thoughts at the present moment - anything about external objects or other minds, about the past or the future? This course will introduce the case for a negative answer, that we are doomed to solipsism and skepticism. In order to evaluate this answer - and hopefully to resist it - we will need to consider the nature, sources, and structure of knowledge and of justification or evidence. This will lead to an examination of foundationalism, coherentism, and externalis - philosophical theories that provide competing accounts of how we might avoid extreme skepticism. Readings will be drawn from classic sources, such as Descartes, Locke, Hume, Moore, Russell, Ayer, and Quine, and more recent authors. We will take up some special topics: e.g., mysticism, innate knowledge, peer disagreement, feminist epistemology, and the ethics of belief. No prerequisites."
PHIL,222,"This course will explore the central doctrines and arguments of the three most important figures in ancient Greek philosophy: Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Socrates appears not to have left any writings. So we shall begin by reading
Plato's Socratic dialogues and consider the problems associated with recovering the historical Socrates from these and other ancient sources. We shall then turn our
attention to Plato's own distinctive doctrines, focusing upon his theory of the soul, his theory of forms, his cosmology, and his ethics. Problems to be discussed include the relative chronology of Plato's dialogues and the criticism and revision of the theory of forms apparent in some of Plato's late dialogues. We shall also consider the possibility of recovering Plato's so-called Unwritten Doctrine. Our study
of Aristotle will involve the detailed examination of several texts central to his physics and metaphysics. We shall focus first upon his criticism of Plato's theory of forms, as well as his criticism of Pre-Socratic philosophers, in response to which he developed several of his own characteristic doctrines. These include his theory of the categories of being and the primacy of substance, his analyses of change in
nature and the doctrine of the four causes, the nature of time, space, and the infinite, and his theory of the soul in relation to body and intellect. Students will also have to the chance to read about and engage in some contemporary debates concerning the interpretation of Plato and Aristotle. Prerequisites: Sophomore standing or above."
PHIL,223,"Histories of philosophy often leave the impression that philosophy in Western antiquity ended with Plato and Aristotle. But in the Mediterranean world after Alexander the Great and down to the ultimate victory of Christianity, the intellectual landscape was dominated by a very different group of philosophies: Stoicism, founded by Semitic thinkers and focused on a belief in fate and duty; Epicureanism, a seemingly atheistic belief in science and pleasure; and the Skepticism of Plato's Academy. They argued over the issues that guided people's lives. How do we achieve happiness? What are the greatest good and the greatest evil? What role do the gods play? How do we live in harmony with nature? Are women equal to men? And what about slavery? What happens to me after death? In answering these questions, these schools established the concepts and arguments that defined the intellectual world of late antiquity and Western Europe well into the modern period. We will engage with these questions and arguments in this formative phase, in which science, philosophy, and religion were not distinguished as they are today. Whereas for Plato and Aristotle we possess their own works, almost all that we have of these philosophers has been handed down to us by others: Later adherents, Greek historians of philosophy (Sextus Empiricus and Diogenes Laertius), and often by Christian authors seeking to refute pagan ways of thinking. We must reconstruct the original source in order to critique it. Students will be encouraged and expected to argue with these thinkers, in class and in papers. No prerequisites."
PHIL,225,"Existentialism is an important and very influential intellectual movement that flourished in the middle of the twentieth century.  Emphasizing and indeed thematizing the human being's search for meaning in an uncertain and apparently meaningless universe, it achieved wide resonance among writers, thinkers, and artists in a world still reeling from the horrors of the two world wars.   It centered around such writers as Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, although the movement appropriated, and was to some extent influenced by, such earlier writers as Kierkegaard, Dostoyevsky, and Kafka.  As a philosophical perspective, however, it is directly indebted to, and continuous with, the phenomenological movement initiated by Edmund Husserl in the first decades of the twentieth century, and especially as Husserl's phenomenology was developed and revised by his erstwhile collaborator, Martin Heidegger.  This course will therefore focus upon the development of phenomenology, beginning with Husserl's attempt to establish an a priori science of the universal structures of human consciousness, and culminating in Sartre's humanistic existentialism.  Some emphasis will placed on the pivotal--and controversial--figure of Heidegger, whose Being and Time (arguably the most influential philosophical text of the twentieth century) presumed to have transformed Husserl's phenomenology into a comprehensive and radical revision of traditional philosophical thinking."

PHIL,227,"This course considers the philosophical analysis of the nature and meaning of art and beauty by reading and discussing  classical and contemporary works concerned with both the ontology and the evaluation of works of art.  We examine such theories as representationalism, expressionism, and formalism, and consider such questions as whether aesthetic judgments can ever claim objectivity or must instead be considered always merely matters of taste, whether the intention of the artist is relevant in the evaluation of works of art, and whether there can be anything other than context that determines whether an object is a work of art.  Our concerns are with both fine art and popular art in general as well as the various distinct realms of art (e.g., the visual arts, music, theartre arts, literature, etc.). Familiarity with the history of the arts is helpful, but not required. Prerequisites for 200- and 300 levels are completion of Seminar III and at least one philosophy course at Simon’s Rock; additional prerequisites for 300-level are Junior or Senior standing. Permission of instructor is also possible."

PHIL,231,"This course is an introduction to Islamic religious and philosophical thought, by examining the distinctive problems, doctrines, and arguments that characterize Islamic thought in its classical period (c. 800-1200 C.E.)  It provides a preliminary discussion of the early history of Islam and of the Qur'anic (and other) foundations for the fundamental religious practices and beliefs, as well as an overview of the various competing theological schools and doctrines. Some emphasis is placed upon the distinction - and conflict - between philosophy and theology in Islam, especially as this tension manifests in the issues of whether and how to reconcile Greek philosophical and scientific learning with Islam and what is the role of reason in Islamic conceptions of human well-being. In addition, we consider the peculiarly Islamic philosophical treatments of classic problems in metaphysics: the nature of the soul and its relation to the body, the eternity of the world, and the nature of causality. There is also some discussion of the development of both religious and philosophical mysticism in Islam (especially Sufism). While the course considers the most important and influential thinkers from across the Islamic world, there is some focus on Andalusia (Mediaeval Muslim Spain) which gave rise to a distinctive philosophical school that culminates in Ibn Rush'd (Averroes) - the greatest of the mediaeval Islamic philosophers).

PHIL,232,"In the last twenty years, there has been an explosion in human knowledge about exoplanets (=planets around other stars), and extended, detailed robotic study of another planet (Mars). In the next twenty, we will have be able to detect atmospheric biomarkers on exoplanets and may land humans on Mars. This course examines conceptual, social, and ethical issues related to the search for extraterrestrial life and the exploration of space. We study the Fermi paradox, space treaties, the role of private industry, the definition of life, listening for extraterrestrials, and Copernican reasoning. We also study the ethics of space travel, planetary protection, and recent attempts by private groups to message extraterrestrials. Our methods will of necessity be interdisciplinary, as our subject relates to the history of colonization, the social organization and psychological aspects of exploration, and the biological and physical sciences. Prerequisite: One course in either the Science or Social Studies division."
PHIL,277,"Some of the most contentious debates in public morality today arise in the context of the practice of medicine and medical research. Many of these debates are the result of continuously advancing medical technologies that challenge our conception of what it is to be a human being and force us to consider the relation between our conceptions of ourselves as biological beings and as moral beings. We
shall thus study the ethics of cloning, genetic engineering, stem cell research, and various reproductive technologies and strategies, including abortion, IVF, and surrogate motherhood. In addition, because they are faced with life and death decisions on an almost daily basis, healthcare professionals are frequently faced with moral dilemmas that have an urgency rarely found in other areas of human
activity. It is with this urgency in mind that we shall examine the ethical guidelines that might be established for such end-of-life decisions as advanced directives, DNR orders, euthanasia, and physician-assisted suicide. Finally, because the accessibility and delivery of healthcare is increasingly associated with current notions of justice, we shall examine the ethical issues surrounding the distribution
of resources and managed care, as well as associated issues involving the physician-patient relationship. The course will consider the differences in how these various issues are approached from competing ethical perspectives, including consequentialism, Kantian deontology, and virtue ethics, and special attention will be paid to whether and how the principle of double effect may be invoked to resolve some of these moral dilemmas. Prerequisite: One course in social studies or one course in biology."
PHIL,283,"Environmental Ethics is the study of the nature and extent of our moral obligations with respect to the natural environment as well as of the theoretical justification for such obligations.  In this course we shall be especially interested in examining various theories about whether and how various regions of the environment can have an intrinsic moral value, and how such value should affect our attitudes and actions toward the environment.  Among the specific topics to be covered are animal rights, and the conflicts that arise between animal rights theories and environmental ethics; various extensionist approaches to the assignment of intrinsic moral value to the environment; obligations to future generations; endangered species; deep ecology and ecofeminism as radical alternatives to the extentionist approach to environmental ethics; ethical issues in the restoration and preservation of wilderness areas;  competing perspectives on just what wildnerness is, and what is the place, if any, of human beings within those conceptions of wilderness; whether and how environmental ethics can be reconciled with demands for social justice; and whether and to what extent religion contributes to or helps to resolve the current environmental crisis."
PHIL,310,"What, really, does it mean to be infinite?  Is any actually existing thing really infinite?  This course will explore the role that the notion of the infinite plays in such diverse disciplines as philosophy, theology, mathematics, logic, physics, and computer science.  We will examine both the different kinds of problems that arise in the distinct contexts of these disciplines, and how these diverse disciplines have affected and influenced each other with respect to the concept of infinity.  The course will be both historical and topical, as we examine how the concept of ""infinite"" was transformed from originally meaning ""indefinite"", and thus as entailing imperfection, into a concept that entailed transcendent super-excellent perfection; how Aristotle's distinction between potential and actual infinity led to the solution of a number of problems concerning time, space, and motion; how the development of the notion of the infinitesimal in the 17th century led directly to the discovery of the calculus by Newton and Leibniz; and how Georg Cantor's discovery that infinite sets come in different sizes was initially more welcomed by theologians than by other mathematicians."
PHIL,312,"We will examine a number of issues which arise from philosophical reflection on the practice of science. These include: the distinction between science and pseudoscience; the nature of scientific explanation; the confirmation of scientific

Any formal system powerful enough to do arithmetic is incomplete: there are truths in that system that cannot be proven in that system. In this course, we will complete modern versions of Goedel's First and Second Incompleteness Theorems. In so doing, we will study mathematical induction; the concepts of effective computability, effective axiomatization, and primitive recursion; Peano arithmetic; diagonalization; and results beyond Goedel's such as Tarski's Theorem and the Church-Turing Thesis.

PHIL,326,"Immanuel Kant is the most influential philosopher of the last 250 years.  Much of the subsequent history of philosophy is either a reaction to or development of Kant.  His critical philosophy introduced limits upon what human beings can know, while at the same time determining precisely what it is that the human mind itself contributes to its experience of the world.   With Kant, the human mind is no longer considered a mere passive observer, but is instead understood to be an active participant in the world that it structures.

PHIL,327,"Cows are quite different things from the word ‘cow’. The former have four stomachs, placid dispositions, and cute eyes; the latter, none of these things – in fact, it is tough to say what the word ‘cow’ is! So how can the word ‘cow’ be about cows? Is there anything to the meaning of the word ‘cow’ other than that it refers to cows? How can sentences about cows be true representations of cows in the world? In this course, we take such questions of semantics and truth as our fundamental subjects of inquiry. We will examine various theories of meaning, reference, and the intentionality of language, focusing particularly on analytic philosophy in the 20th century. In addition, we will inquire into other important areas in the philosophy of language. How do we use language to bring into being obligations (‘I promise you three cows’) and other extralinguistic facts (‘I hereby pronounce you…’)? How do we convey meaning with language that is literally false (‘Your eyes shine like the sun’) or tautological (‘What is, is’)? How do names get their significance? How can we ever interpret other people’s meaning (whether in our own language or another)? And how are we able to talk meaningfully about counterfactual states of affairs (‘if there weren’t so many cows, the planet would not being heating up this quickly’)?

This course will involve a close reading of two of the most influential works in the history of philosophy.  The first of these is The Incoherence of the Philosophers, by the 11th century C.E. Islamic theologian Al-Ghazali.   This is a detailed and skeptical critique of Aristotelian doctrines, especially as developed and defended by Avicenna.  The second work is The Incoherence of the Incoherence, by Averroes, the great 12th century Islamic philosopher and Commentator of Aristotle.  This work is a point-by-point refutation of Ghazali’s arguments, which thus forms one of the great defenses of the discipline of philosophy against the attacks of the theologians.  The influence of these two works was decisive for scholastic and renaissance philosophy of the Latin Christian West, and persisted directly right through to the Early Modern period of European philosophy.  The quality is reasoning is very high throughout these works, and the arguments and counter-arguments sometimes very subtle.  The works cover a wide range of subjects, from the eternity of the world, to the immortality of the soul, and the relation between cause and effects.  Because both works are quite large, and will be read simultaneously, it will not be possible to get through the whole of these works.  However, students can expect to cover a substantial portion of them.  Along the way, students can expect to improve not only their knowledge of a formative period in the history of philosophy, but deepen their philosophical skills by learning from these outstanding exemplars of high quality and subtle philosophical reasoning.  Prerequisites: at least one course in philosophy or permission of instructor."
PHIL,383,"Environmental Ethics is the study of the nature and extent of our moral obligations with respect to the environment as well as of the theoretical justification for such obligations.  In this course we shall be especially interested in examining various theories about whether and how various regions of the environment can have an intrinsic moral value, and how such value should affect our attitudes and actions toward our natural environment.  We shall also be concerned with the question of whether and to what extent the ethical questions can be and should be informed by environmental science, as well as with gaining a clear understanding on the limits of science with respect to problems and questions of ethics and morality.  Among the specific topics to be covered are animal rights, and the conflicts that arise between animal rights theories and environmental ethics; various extensionist approaches to the assignment of intrinsic moral value to the environment; deep ecology and ecofeminism as radical alternatives to the extentionist approach to environmental ethics; ethical issues in the restoration and preservation of wilderness areas;  whether and how environmental ethics can be reconciled with demands for social justice; and whether and to what extent religion contributes to or helps to resolve the current environmental crisis.   Special attention will be given to the ethical issues stemming from global warming and climate change, especially in light of the United Nations Copenhagen Agreement, currently being negotiated.

PHIL,207M,"Daoism has had a major impact on Chinese intellectual and spiritual life for over two millennia. A philosophy that emphasizes individual development, immersion in nature, the rejection of societal convention, and the cultivation of natural virtue, it has been embraced by scholars, painters, poets, and political thinkers. A religion derived from classical philosophy, folk practices, Buddhism, and Yogic
techniques, it perseveres in village rituals, global popular culture, and dissident sects like China's Falungong. Taijiquan is a Daoist system of moving meditation and a martial art based on slowly flowing and subtly configured motions. Practiced worldwide, it is ""the dance of Daoism,"" providing insight and personal experience of Daoist principles found in major texts like the Dao De Jing, Zhuangzi, and Liezi. This course provides students with the opportunity to read classical texts on Daoism and Taijiquan and to study the Thirteen Postures, a Yang style form of Taijiquan. We also read Daoist nature poetry, Tang dynasty Daoist short stories, and an account of the life of Guan Saihong, a Daoist master (and if possible, we will have Guan visit the class). Our practice of Taijiquan and work on textual interpretation is supplemented with free-ranging discussions (talks) on Daoism in the spirit of the School of Pure Conversation, a Daoist group of the first millennium that emphasized free expression and a sharpening of the imagination. No prerequisites."
PHIL,278M,"Some of the most contentious debates in public morality today arise in the context of the practice of medicine and medical research.  Many of these debates are the result of continuously advancing medical technologies that challenge our conception of what it is to be a human being and force us to consider the relation between our conceptions of ourselves as biological beings and as moral beings.  We thus study the ethics of cloning, genetic engineering, stem cell research, and various reproductive technologies.  In addition, we examine the ethical guidelines that might be established for such end of life decisions as advanced directives, DNR orders, euthanasia, and physician-assisted suicide.  Finally, because the notion of informed consent is foundational for much of the ethical consideration of medical practice and research, we consider how this notion informs the physician-patient relationships, and the limits it places upon morally acceptable medical research. No prerequisites."

POLS,100,"This course explores the concept, domain and discipline of politics. We will engage with various attempts to define and determine the nature, form, content and extent of “the political.” In doing so, we may be able to get to the tense and conflicting sources of our own current understandings of politics, its subjects and objects. It is important to remember that the course does not take any of the assigned readings as the final word on the topic. Rather, we will visit each featured thinker as agnostics and critics, earnestly working with and through them over the course of the semester to (1) become fluent in basic concepts and terms at work, and (2) to come up with our own speculations about what constitutes the political; when, where and how politics happens; what it means to think, ask, and act politically; and what being a student of politics may entail."

It is designed as a multi-perspectival introduction to what might seem like questions we have always thought about, and what we already have opinions on. The course pushes us to acknowledge the premises of our opinions, our minds already made, and our pathos already bought and sold! In order to confront current problems, the course maintains, we must step assess, improve, and build the edifices and the scaffoldings of both our thought and action. Our manner of approach is inseparable from the nature and demands objects we encounter, so our relations to them are essential as we decide how to play a role in the world, which we each do in our own way.

Prerequisites for this course at the 300 level are Completion of at least one 200-level social studies class and Completion of Sophomore Seminar or permission of instructor."
POLS,213,"Both the American and the French revolutions of the eighteenth century cried freedom in their respective languages, and ushered in at least a century-long struggle with the notion of freedom among political philosophers on the continent and beyond.  It can be argured that those debates and systematisations, in all their divergences and convergences, have come to frame philosophical and political negotiations, hopes and frustations, solidarities and rebellions, in the past century.
  This course attempts to map this motley inheritance that provides the fabric for many contemporary confrontations with the concept, imperative, imaginary, or enactment, if you may, of ""freedom.""  Beginning with a noted philosopher of the French revolution, Immanuel Kant, to whom is the ""invention"" of the modern notion of autonomy as well as the inaugural of a certain legacy of German idealism, the course moves to thinkers who negotiate with Kant to install their own legacy.    Notable among these is GWF Hegel, and an entire ""troubled generation"" of his followers and dissenters - the Young Hegelians - the practices, concerns, restlessnesses and skirmishes of whom seem uncannily similar to many of our own times.  Key among these skirmishes is the debate between materialist and idealist notions of freedom- sometimes framed as a battle over the most historically and materially pertinent summoning of the Greeks to the rescue, sometimes as a lived struggle between the priority of policitcs and philosophy, among others.  The course closes with a peculiar Young Hegelian, Karl Marx, and a Danish philosopher , Soren Kierkegaard.  Studying each philosopher's approach sequentially, the course traces the theme of freedom throughout different variations from the eighteenth century revolutions to nineteenth century ones, with special attention to how these thinkers navigate the idealism-materialism spectrum.
  Unifying these thinkers in their diversity is, to quote a contemporary commentator their insistence on ¿making [their work] a relevant player in the contemporary liberation drama.¿ This includes their focus on the relation between politics and philosophy, and their concern with what the role of the philosopher and thinker might, could and should, be in rethinking and actualising freedom as a value, and what this may entail."
POLS,215,"The course probes the embodiment of politics in cultural forms pivoting, in this version of the course, on cinema and cinematically-inspired artworks. It is an exploration of the cultural lifeworlds of colonial peoples, as it manifests through history, during and after (or so some say) colonization. Achille Mbembe speaks of the postcolony as an entanglement of timescapes. Cinematic texts, timescapes in their own right, provide unique insights into not only these temporalities, but also the spatial organisations of political and legal power, extending Eyal Weizman's framework of forensic architecture in relation to terror, occupation, and postcolonial violence.  The course attempts to bring into relief the interrelation between the spatial, visual, and temporal aspects of ordinary life in the post/colony.  

In addition, cinema serves as an accessible and visible component of a ""culture industry"" whose actions and political economic history under and beyond colonialism can shed light on the dynamics of old and new colonialisms, as manifest in big events and everyday life, at play and at work, in grief and in love, in the public and private spheres, alike. There are many ways of imagining what is produced, distributed, consumed, laboured for, within this industry that not only illuminate colonization of a life-world, but also expose colonization as a lifeworld, producing its own forms of subjection and redemption. 

The regional focus of this version of the course is the South Asian subcontinent, with its cinemas brought into conversation with British colonial cinema and other postcolonial cinemas in the Middle East and North Africa where possible. 

There will be required weekly screenings of films outside of class time. 

Prerequisite: 
300-level: 1 200-level course in politics and 1 200-level course in literature or film.
200-level: 1 100-level course in social studies and 1 100-level course in literature or the arts."
POLS,219,"The course explores the genealogy of contemporary debates over the relation between politics and religion. It confronts an interesting paradox: often we complain about how so many contemporary political conflicts emerge from an unhealthy attachment to histories of religious war and conflict, but at the same time many proposed ways forward use concepts deeply indebted to those histories. Indeed, many of these concepts emerge from a particular view of European history, and the course investigates other cultural and intellectual paradigms and discourses that may propose different relations between politics and religion. We consider intellectual and philosophical debates, the effect of religious laws and traditions on the practice of politics, and the influence of politics on religious and theological discourse and practice. We turn to the Crusades, medieval political thought, the invention of race, Renaissance attempts at secularism, eventually entering the modern era as one obsessed with creating and administering walls between the political and the theological, the church and the state, among others, overseeing a supposed exit of religion from politics. We also consider modern and postmodern engagements with liberal secularism, and the subsequent attempts to re-enchant our political existences. Ours is an era of religious fundamentalism and fanaticism, and also of atheists joining with orthodox theologians to think past capitalism and other terrors. This course goes past the seeming contradiction to ask what sponsors this coincidence, and what kinds of thought and action are demanded of us in this moment."
POLS,221,"This course examines the material, practical, and conceptual relations between politics, poetics, and aesthetics as activities in which we manifest our relations to power, our location within dominant temporal and spatial regimes, and our capacities of knowing, being, and feeling.  The intersections between politikos (the statics and dynamics of life where individuals need and shape each other and the commons enclosed by the polis), aisthesis (perception through the senses and the intellect), and poeisis (making, producing, bringing-forth), are complex, plentiful, and serve as a premise of this course. The course begins by exploring inheritances that supply the aesthetic and the political categories of our lives today, analyzing how they are implicated in systems of subjugation and freedom, both real and imagined. Some of the issues considered are: the history of ""the aesthetic"" as a realm of political contestation; the relation between aesthetic and political judgments; artistic and cultural production as sites of critique, diagnosis, and political struggle; the autonomy and complicity of art in relation to politics; western Enlightenment discourse and the demands of critical and decolonial aesthetics; the promise and problem of turning to the senses, the passions, and “the body” as final arbiters of truth and the means to counter narratives of injustice and unfreedom. The course addresses these questions by turning to, among others, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Adorno, Brecht, Benjamin, Bloch, Arendt, Eagleton, Murdoch, Spivak, Bahri, Terada, Wynter, and Ranciere. Prerequisites: 
Successful completion of Seminar III. (Interested first-year students must have successfully completed POLS 225, or be co-enrolled in POLS 100.) 


"
POLS,225,"This course is a survey of modern and contemporary political ideologies and worldviews. It begins with an exploration of the term ""ideology"" and its importance to the study and practice of politics. How are ideas composed to form ideologies
that in turn structure the world for us? Are ideologies only a modern phenomenon? We see how the key concepts of politics--for instance, freedom, equality, justice, democracy, power, citizen--are framed within each ideology we encounter, en route to figuring out how each ideology then shapes the very domain of politics, and prescribes for us the meaning of our lives, our contentions and contestations,
and our basic human and political struggles. The course also hopes to make us more attentive in our use of words, labels, and categories in politics, to see the nuances within the terms we employ in our everyday lives, appreciating their many interpretations and histories, and to rise to the challenge and the responsibility that comes with this appreciation. No prerequisites."
POLS,226,"This course is a historical survey of U.S. political thought from the founding to the present. Modeled on the notorious TV show, this course stages a contest for the title of ""American Idol"" among a wide array of figures, ranging from the Puritans to Tony Kushner, and from Horatio Alger to Malcolm X, who have made the cut to the course to compete for the title. Together we will examine questions like: What is ""American"" about American political thought? How has this identity come to be and what has it represented over the course of its evolution? How have different thinkers envisioned and critiqued the shape of the state and culture of the United States? What makes democracy American and America democratic? What are the peculiar ways in which time and space interact to yield the concepts we call America and the American dream? What negotiation with history does the US celebration of newness, possibility, hope, and amnesia entail? We discuss a variety of works, in forms ranging from political treatises, journalism, philosophical writing, speeches, essays, autobiographies, fiction, poems, Supreme Court decisions, music, plays, and films. This plurality of forms--not to mention the course title's unabashed debt to features of US popular culture--forces us to center on the relation between various forms of media and political consciousness at individual and collective levels. Through the course, we familiarize ourselves with the ideas of some key figures in the history and genealogy of U.S. political thought, practice theoretical and critical engagement with them and the problems they are addressing, learn some skills of democratic citizenship, explore our own views and political identity, and elect an American Idol for ourselves! No prerequisites.

Students evaluate case studies focused on specific scenarios involving issues like climate adaptation and regenerative agricultural practices and companies like US-based Patagonia and transnational Unilever that have attempted to implement these practices. Students also explore the writing of theorists (i.e., Donella Meadows, Vandana Shiva) who have developed and advocated for these reforms, and practitioners (i.e., William McDonough, Michael Braungart) who have attempted to implement them. This course meets concentration requirements for Political Studies, Food Studies, and Environmental and Sustainability Studies. Prerequisite: Completion of Seminar 1 or permission of professor."
POLS,229,"This course is designed in response to a range of contemporary and enduring “crises” and challenges of higher education. We look at some manifestations of these crises in the US and Europe in order to expose the local and global historical motions and tendencies that both culminate in and ensue from these events, and to examine the various social and political philosophies that have highlighted the role of education as a means of producing conditions of democratic possibility as well as a response to those conditions. Some of the issues raised span higher education reform, neoliberalism and the financial crisis, the liberal arts “mission” and the crisis of the humanities, the corporatization of the university, intellectual emancipation and social justice education, institutional barriers to diversity and inclusion, decolonial and feminist pedagogies, intercultural education, pedagogies of reconciliation, constructions of public intellectuals and activist scholars, unions in the university, radical experiments in higher education, and the impact of politico-economic regimes on the nature of the university.  Notable thinkers at the nexus of education, democracy, and politics assisting us in our analyses include, but are not limited to, Jacques Ranciere, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, John Dewey, W.E.B. Dubois, Linda Tuhiwai Smith, bell hooks, Sara Ahmed, Peter Euben, Paulo Freire, Gayatri Spivak, Amy Gutmann, Henry Giroux, Leon Botstein, and several former and current Simon’s Rock faculty and students. Bringing together an engagement with current issues that plague the university with a historical and political analysis of the role of education in a democracy, the course hopes to inspire a deep understanding of the structures within which students and teachers do the work they do, and a passionate inquiry into our roles in a broader quest to transform those structures toward justice, equality, and freedom for more of us. The class is designed to be a collaborative, participatory, performative staging of a scene of democratic, aesthetic, and political education, with outputs that will be determined through the interactions. No prerequisites.

POLS,234,"The words refugee & fugitive share a root in fugere, meaning ""to flee."" Playing on the related concept of the fugue which, both in music and psychiatry, captures some sense of a tethered, burgeoning motion, this course approaches political imagination and practice from the perspective of those considered outside and inimical to the polis--not the founder, not the native, not the citizen, not the soldier, not the settler--and whose movements do not reassure the dominant ideas of home and sovereignty informing maps of the world as drawn today. In a moment where our own county is experiencing a community-led and governmental process with incoming refugees of global wars, this course combines (1) an investigation into the intersecting geneaologies of the refugee, the fugitive, and the exile as carrying important lessons for rethinking politics and where and how it happens, (2) a study of the history and politics of refuge and exile in the international state system, (3) an examination of the contemporary global refugee crisis and its political, ethical, and aesthetic dimensions, and (4) a close engagement with the local politics of refugee resettlement."
POLS,235,"Why do we choose as a nation to systematically educate our citizens? As people and nation, how do we decide what we teach, how we teach, who we teach, and what  resources we devote to an individual student and educational system? This course is designed to answer these questions, introducing students to the politics and policy of current and historical educational debates with a focus on the U.S. school system—public, independent, charter, and for-profit."
POLS,240,"We study two great political-economic transitions: first, China's move from early attempts at modernization at the end of the Qing dynasty to the consolidation of Communist power    under Mao and its subsequent inclinations towards state-led capitalism; second, the emergence of Bolshevik Communism following the Russian Revolution and the subsequent developments in the USSR and its successor states. The two historical examples provide an occasion to develop a comparative method for the study of the institutions of political economy, and the underlying tensions between economy and politics; stasis and change; and theory and practice. In this comparative frame, we study the material, ideological, and aesthetic dimensions of political economy. The class develops essential themes for students of economics and politics, but students are also encouraged to integrate their work from other disciplinary perspectives (literary, aesthetic, quantitative). Prerequisite: an economics or politics course at the 200 level, or permission of the instructor.

POLS,306,"This course is designed as a toolbox containing the various methods and approaches available, and used by political scientists, to study major political problems, to compare them, to theorize about them, and possibly also to figure out ways to solve them. It will involve a sustained look at the importance, mechanics and problems of these practices as they pertain to issues of modernization, development and underdevelopment; violence and terrorism; globalization; revolution, protest and social movements; ethnicity and nationalism; democracy and democratization; authoritarianism and corruption; inequality; civil society; and political institutions."
POLS,310,"This course approaches global politics through some fundamental questions pertaining to our everyday lives as citizens of this world, and the lenses used are multiple and integrated into a rigorous grounding on questions of power, inequality, boundaries, justice, war, immigration, terrorism, as well as other essential issues unspoken of within the grand worries of our times. It is designed as a multi-perspectival introduction to what might seem like questions we have always thought about, and what we already have opinions on. The course pushes us to acknowledge the premises of our opinions, our minds already made, and our pathos already bought and sold! In order to confront current problems, the course maintains, we must step assess, improve, and build the edifices and the scaffoldings of both our thought and action. Our manner of approach is inseparable from the nature and demands objects we encounter, so our relations to them are essential as we decide how to play a role in the world, which we each do in our own way. The prerequisite for this course at the 200 level is completion of one social studies course. Prerequisites for this course at the 300 level are Completion of at least one 200-level social studies class and Completion of Sophomore Seminar or permission of instructor."
POLS,311,"The course explores the genealogy of contemporary debates over the relation between politics and religion. It confronts an interesting paradox: often we complain about how so many contemporary political conflicts emerge from an unhealthy attachment to histories of religious war and conflict, but at the same time many proposed ways forward use concepts deeply indebted to those histories. Indeed, many of these concepts emerge from a particular view of European history, and the course investigates other cultural and intellectual paradigms and discourses that may propose different relations between politics and religion. We consider intellectual and philosophical debates, the effect of religious laws and traditions on the practice of politics, and the influence of politics on religious and theological discourse and practice. We turn to the Crusades, medieval political thought, the invention of race, Renaissance attempts at secularism, eventually entering the modern era as one obsessed with creating and administering walls between the political and the theological, the church and the state, among others, overseeing a supposed exit of religion from politics. We also consider modern and postmodern engagements with liberal secularism, and the subsequent attempts to re-enchant our political existences. Ours is an era of religious fundamentalism and fanaticism, and also of atheists joining with orthodox theologians to think past capitalism and other terrors. This course goes past the seeming contradiction to ask what sponsors this coincidence, and what kinds of thought and action are demanded of us in this moment."
POLS,314,"The course probes the embodiment of politics in cultural forms pivoting, in this version of the course, on cinema and cinematically-inspired artworks. It is an exploration of the cultural lifeworlds of colonial peoples, as it manifests through history, during and after (or so some say) colonization. Achille Mbembe speaks of the postcolony as an entanglement of timescapes. Cinematic texts, timescapes in their own right, provide unique insights into not only these temporalities, but also the spatial organisations of political and legal power, extending Eyal Weizman's framework of forensic architecture in relation to terror, occupation, and postcolonial violence.  The course attempts to bring into relief the interrelation between the spatial, visual, and temporal aspects of ordinary life in the post/colony.  

In addition, cinema serves as an accessible and visible component of a ""culture industry"" whose actions and political economic history under and beyond colonialism can shed light on the dynamics of old and new colonialisms, as manifest in big events and everyday life, at play and at work, in grief and in love, in the public and private spheres, alike. There are many ways of imagining what is produced, distributed, consumed, laboured for, within this industry that not only illuminate colonization of a life-world, but also expose colonization as a lifeworld, producing its own forms of subjection and redemption. 

The regional focus of this version of the course is the South Asian subcontinent, with its cinemas brought into conversation with British colonial cinema and other postcolonial cinemas in the Middle East and North Africa where possible. 

There will be required weekly screenings of films outside of class time. 

Prerequisite:

POLS,316,"The works of select women thinkers, writers, characters, actors, artists, wrought within the lifeworlds of capitalism, colonialism, slavery, fascism, empire, patriarchy, and nationalism, occasion this course’s turn to the politics of marginal subjects seeking to thwart the voices, destinies, and narratives conferred to them. The course seeks an approach to political experience, judgment, and struggle anchored in subjects who preface their own destruction, ask questions other than what they are asked, become ""problems"" that will require certain ""solutions,"" evade political programmes designed for their liberation, reject functionalist and positivist cartographies of their beings, becomings, and undoings, and still insist on something—more, better. Not presuming the site or status of womanhood or the woman’s body to be an a priori, already natural, known, or knowable ""object"" of political work, it approaches ""the feminine"" as something to which ""the political"" must confess itself (and not the other way around). Upper college standing and permission of instructor (by email - aabbas@simons-rock.edu) is necessary for this course. Since the instructor will be joining the class remotely, familiarity with the instructor in a classroom setting prior to this one will certainly be helpful.

POLS,325,"The course explores the ways in which human beings create politics through collective action, ordinary and heroic, that finds its logics outside of given institutions, beyond realpolitik as we know it. By looking at social movements
across the globe, and sporting different ideological, moral and pragmatic frames, the course aspires to an alternate formulation of ""real"" politics, what it can and does mean, where it happens and who participates in it. The course has two broad components. The first involves a review of the literature on political and social movements, and addressing questions such as: When and why movements occur? Who joins or supports movements? Who remains and who drops out? What is the role of emotions and ideas in movements? How are movements organized? What do movements do? What are movements seeking to move? How are contemporary
movements different from older ones? How do movements change, grow, and decline? What do they accomplish? Some of the historical cases studied in order to
address these questions include: the civil rights movement, the women's movement, the labor movement, the gay liberation movement, the Iranian revolution, pro-life and prochoice movements, the green movement, WTO protests, Catholic feminism, the nuclear freeze movement, farmworkers' movements, and the New Left. The second component, titled the Social Action Workshop, is the practical aspect of the course. Students, in groups, map a specified region of Berkshire County for the social and political action groups that exist here. They construct an inventory of these spaces, and apply the questions we broach in the classroom to a movement or group of their choice."
POLS,326,"The poet Stephen Dunn wrote, ""one man's holiness, another's absurdity."" War, democracy, and revolution, though distinct concepts, have interesting continuities, not least of which can be found in the human beings who are at once subjects and objects of these experiences: Citizens, soldiers, revolutionaries, and permutations thereof. These words can connote either discrete events with lessons to be learnt, or realities that never seem to have either beginnings or ends, depending on where we find ourselves on the terrain of class, race, gender, nationality, power, ideology, and various other inexorable accidents of time and space. This course continues the inquiry, into the ways in which human beings create politics, which was begun in Politics by Other Means I: Social Movements and Collective Action. It seeks to explore the materialities of the wars we fight by placing the strategic and empirical realities of wars in a framework of the calls of duty, obligation, love, and death, to which we respond. What is the relation between war and politics, and how has it changed over time? What and who makes a war a war? What can a state demand of whom, and why? How are these demands made and received? Is what is worth living for also worth dying for--also worth killing for? Is it even possible to be a subject of something without being subject to something? Readings drawn from political science, history, philosophy, literature, and popular media will take us through various questions into the relation between war, democracy, and revolution, and in what ways the subjectivities of citizen, soldier, revolutionary, rebel, terrorist, and freedom-fighter have come to be over history and across the globe. Prerequisite: Any 200-level course in social studies."
POLS,327,"This course is devoted to close readings of Karl Marx and some self-proclaimed Marxists. In its previous iterations Georg Lukacs and Walter Benjamin, and then V.I. Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg were featured as key readers of Marx. This time, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the publication of Das Kapital in 1867,   the course focuses on precursors and afterlives of this key work. Approaching Marx as a political analyst, revolutionary, historian, economist, and philosopher, the course highlights the travels of Capital: A Critique of Political Economy in different times and spaces in the world, taking up how its readings have been inflected by historical material conditions of its readers, and what history they have helped materialize. Our focus on this work happens within a broader trajectory of Marx’s own thought, enabling assessments of major shifts in his analyses, and differences in their purported politics. This also involves consulting with deployments of Marx’s thought after his life--within and in relation to revolutionary communism, democratic socialism, anti-colonialism, anti-fascism, and black radicalism, for instance. The shift between Marxist formations around WWI and those that proliferate in the years surrounding WWII, will be of particular interest to us in the current moment.

POLS,328,"This advanced seminar surveys major currents and problems in the corpus of democratic theory. Is democracy an ideal, an ethos, a system. a judgment, a tool, or a mechanism? What are its origins and associations, its contents and discontents? What is the relation of democracy to liberatory politics on the one hand and to the colonial project on the other? How has democracy dealt with exclusions, and how do we judge democracies today? We address how democracy and its supposed associates, such as freedom, equality, justice, and self-government, are shaped in relation to each other in various historical and geographic contexts, and how these appear in different models of democracy. We also look at the relation of democratic thought to notions of ""the people,"" publics, identity, deliberation, voice, community, representation, recognition, redistribution, right, inclusion, revolution, sovereignty, authority, order, legitimacy, nation, civil society, etc., and at how everyday framings of our relation to the state and society emerge. The course visits classical texts on the theory and practice of democracy, and turns to contemporary democratic theory (its deliberative, radical, liberal and agonistic conceptions) and to works that delineate its various potentials, antagonisms, and complicities. Placing longstanding debates into current context, not least that of our struggles as a community at Simon's Rock, we ask and answer important questions about the value, liability, possibility and promise of a democratic present and future. Historical analysis of some major events in the history of democratic practice and process mediates this inquiry and we observe how big shifts in the democratic imagination are reflect what people have pushed democracy to do, and how these imaginings straddle the realms of theory and practice, philosophy and politics, idea and reality, process and outcome. Readings will draw on, among other thinkers, Aristotle, Daniel Allen, Seyla Benhabib, Lani Guinier, Jurgen Habermas, David Held, Bonnie Honig, Patchen Markell, Achille Mbembe, Charles Mills, Carole Pateman, Chantal Mouffe, Joel Olson, Jacques Ranciere, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Michael Warner, and Melissa Williams.
Prerequisite: POLS 100 or a 200-level course in social studies."
POLS,330,"This course will involve close readings of the works of Jean-Jacques Rousseau as an exemplary purveyor of a form of political philosophy that makes a turn to the common, the ordinary, the spontaneous, the accidental, the necessary, the bound, the free, the imaginary, the imaginable, the whimsical, the paranoid, the sentimental, the beloved, and the unlovable in us, and tries to conserve a notion of politics as a vital and human in response to forces of antipolitics. In doing so, he certainly inherits a struggle that dates back to the earliest known western political philosophy, but the mode in which he encounters and embodies this struggle contains clues to forces and dynamics beyond him, as he becomes a veritable symptom--as both captive and critic--of modernity. His life and his relations to others and to a society coming to understand itself as modern are a significant part of the picture, thus there is no way to fully appreciate him without attending to the circumstances and the incorporations that made Rousseau possible. Thus, the course will also involve explicit attention to the predecessors, contemporaries, and successors of Rousseau--he thus invites, even necessitates, a close analysis of the full scope of the modern and its politics, by appreciating and assessing the trends that he instantiates, institutes, and reacts to. Issues ranging from morality, religion, the human, language, self, identity, narrative, performance, science, and aesthetics, to to the promise of freedom, community, transformation, and revolution become etched within a philosophy that heralds the political and the social as its only worthy site and destiny. Other options are not available, thus the urgency to turn to Rousseau in what often feels like an infantilising and farcical political climate of tragic impossibility. His untimely work and its genealogy, without merely requiring affirmation and agreement, affords us many inlets into understanding the conditions in which we find ourselves. The fact that he is often ostensibly misunderstood, even by those who bear great resemblance to him in many ways (like Marx and Nietzsche) puts even more onus on us as readers, friends, and political beings! Students interested in and prepared to read Rousseau in its original French, may be able to combine this with a tutorial in French literature.

POLS,332,"What exactly did it take to ensure that the sun never set on the British Empire? From labour laws that put 6 year-old boys to work in the blacking factories in London, to the disposable bodies of natives and slaves producing tea and silk in the East, and sugar and cotton in the West, a very specific moral and political economy was put in place that traversed entire oceans and needed nourishment and maintenance in spaces of the colony and metropole alike. The colonial search for home, and romance of being at home everywhere in the world, produced a mode of hospitality and subjugation that necessitated the colony at home and abroad. Undoing or unmaking this lifeworld of the colony, it follows, has required more than passing of laws and drawing of boundaries. 
The goal of this two-semester course is to track the coexistence and intertwinement of capitalism and colonialism. Part I (Fall 2014) will posit that ""the colony is always already inside capital, and capital always already inside the colony"" and model an examination of this claim through an extended case- study of the British Empire, spurring investigation into other empires of the modern age and a comparison to older imperialisms, to see the political, philosophical, economic, social, and cultural systems that together materialise these lifeworlds.
Part II (Spring 2014) will continue to probe the entanglement and interpenetration of capital and colony into the era of decolonisation and well into the postcolony, by tracking the emergence of anticolonial movements, their claims, philosophies, and tactics, and tagging their roots and destinies in, and their convergences and divergences from, from an anti-capitalist politics. An examination of the literary and artistic movements that emerge in anticolonial struggles will be crucial to understanding the broader poetics and aesthetics of anticolonialism, anticapitalism, nationalism and internationalism.

This course probes the entanglement and interpenetration of capitalism and colonialism into the unfinished era of decolonisation and well into the postcolony. It tracks the emergence of anticolonial movements, their claims, philosophies, and tactics, and their relations to struggles against capitalism. We examine the intersecting genealogies of capitalism and colonialism by proceeding from peoples’ resistance to them. We delve into how people have articulated their desires, positions, friends, allies, and enemies, and how their ideas and actions have exposed the roots, destinies, convergences, and divergences of anti-colonial and anti-capitalist politics. In this course, special emphasis is placed on apprehending the variations of political method within and across these struggles, and also at different levels of materiality, visibility, and legibility. Thus, an examination of the literary, philosophical, and artistic movements that emerge in anticolonial struggles is central to understanding the broader poetics and aesthetics of anticolonialism, anticapitalism, nationalism, and internationalism. While students build their own archives for inquiry around areas/movements of their choosing, our collective efforts draw on an abundant and hospitable canon of anticolonial and anticapitalist life, thought, and movement histories new and old, from Haiti to Occupy Wall Street, from Australia to Palestine. A hope is that at the end of this course, we might be more able to (1) question the premises shared by colonialism and capitalism and the political thought and imperatives they have naturalized, (2) avoid the trap of separating out the histories of various contemporary oppressions everywhere from the seemingly “local” histories of colonialism and capitalism, and (3) produce political action that does not sacrifice thought.

POLS,335,"The goal of this course is to turn our attention to listening and away from the emphasis on speaking one’s voice—the dominant framework in most strains of modern western political philosophy. While examining the history of the hierarchy of senses and their associated actions in various political, economic, pedagogical, and legal systems, the course also engages the centrality of listening in radical spheres, which often exposes hidden injustices within these spheres. From the centrality of the Azan in Islam and moments of silence across many cultural traditions, from wiretapping to bearing witness, from national radio propaganda to the blues, we consider the various soundscapes of politics across a range of our actions, passions, and interactions. To this end, we draw from the history of political and aesthetic thought and practice, the history of technology, and the abundant oeuvre of contemporary voice and sound artists from around the world. The title of the course, itself, draws from a series of works by Lawrence Abu Hamdan who addresses the intersection of sound and politics.

PSYC,226,"This course will introduce, compare and critique psychodynamic principles of psychological development and their utility in clinical social work practice. Students will learn and compare the theoretical concepts of drive theory, ego psychology, object relations, self psychology, and interpersonal theory. This course will explore points of agreement and disagreement throughout the evolution of psychoanalytic theories by tracing the history of contemporary psychoanalytic thought from Freud to the many forms of clinical practice that exist today. Students will consider the complexities of race, class, gender, culture, and other forms of diversity as we discuss views about normality and pathology, development and dysfunction, and we examine theories for particular sets of values and the sociocultural contexts in which they developed. Students will apply contemporary analytic theories to current case examples and use psychodynamic frameworks to illuminate clinical phenomenon, infusing psychoanalytic ideas into current psychotherapeutic approaches, and connecting theoretical formulation to treatment. Taught from an historical perspective, the course begins with classic psychoanalytic theory. As we go through each theoretical tradition, we will use current clinical illustrations from a range of practice settings.  Students will be introduced to the work of many theorists since Freud, including Ferenczi , Balint, Mahler, Sullivan, Klein, Fairbairn, Winnicott, Erikson, Kohut, Kernberg, Schafer, Lacan, and Loewald. While we explore the internal, psychological forces that inform people’s behavior, students will be encouraged to consider that no theory of development can fully explicate the complexity of human behavior without considering the impact of outside forces and how people function in their social, cultural, and economic contexts. Prerequisites: Psychology 100 and permission fo the instructor."
PSYC,227,"This course introduces students to the major periods, movements, and scholars in the history of the field of psychology. The approach is to explore both a ""conceptual history"" of the study of the mind and the speculations of nineteenth century philosophy and science that have influenced psychology. The plan for the semester is to begin with a study of the forerunners to modern and even very current discipline, and over the course of the semester introduce students to the times and ideas of individuals who have made significant contributions to the field; this while also studying the analyses of historians of the discipline. Prerequisite: PSYC100 or permission of the instructor."
PSYC,229,"The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the basic structure and function of the human brain, particularly as it relates to cognition, learning, consciousness, and emotion. Students will study the basic functioning of neurons as well as the organization of the brain, with a focus on the areas in the brain involved in all aspects of cognition, including: language, memory, social behavior, affect, spatial behavior, and attention. In the latter part of the course, students will be introduced to the neurological bases of psychological disorders (especially those of thought and emotion) as well as our understanding of the brain’s plasticity and its ability to be repaired and repair itself.  Prerequisites:  PSYC 100 or BIO 100."
PSYC,248,"It has now been more than fifty years since the original work of Stanley Milgram demonstrated the remarkable and widely unpredicted finding that large numbers of individuals in multiple samples of American men and women studied were willing to ""punish"" another person when ordered to do so by an experimenter; this in the context of a psychology experiment on learning and memory.  The prominence of the initial work and the continued salience of such a study and associated findings in the domain of social psychology cannot be over-stated.   In a review Thomas Blass (1991) listed as many as 200 references.  It could well be that dozens more have appeared since then.  It is even the case that as recently as three years ago a replication of the original study with only slight modifications was published (J. Burger, January 2009).  In addition, a diligent search of current psychology and cross disciplinary archives can uncover still further studies and demonstrations that provide evidence that ""obedience"" is prevalent in our society and in many others as well.  The domain of Milgram studies is especially worthy of continuing interest.  This not only because of the vastness of both criticism and praise to which the original work was subjected but also because of events in our current time which suggest that the continuing study of obedience phenomena is necessary even in a democratic society and that social scientists should find a way to safely and ethically investigate the conditions that promote destructive obedience and thereby learn the rudiments of how it can be minimized.

PSYC,306,"Conflicts are inevitable aspects of all human lives; however, what happens over the course of a conflict depends on a variety of factors. What predicts when a conflict will emerge? What predicts when a conflict will escalate? What predicts resolution or a successful negotiation of a resolution? These are all questions addressed in this course, which has three goals. The first two are somewhat academic: (1) that students will become familiar with the literature and research on conflict and negotiation; and (2) that students develop knowledge about the variables that play a role in conflict and the resolution of conflicts. The final goal is more ""hands-on"": (3) that students acquire greater skills for negotiating or resolving conflicts.

SART,364,"Objects are all around us, each with its own specific purpose and function. An object's formal characteristics are often dictated by how it functions and endures. Form creates the tangible and visual qualities of an object. Design is born where these two important factors intersect.  ""Visual engineering"" is the process whereby technical challenges and creative solutions are equally considered in the design and creation of objects. This course will establish and develop design and technical skills that will enable students to conceive, design, and fabricate objects. Conceptual sketches, detailed drawings and a hands-on approach will be required in conjunction with the use of hand and power tools and various materials.Additionally, each project will highlight specific design objectives and challenges within a given set of parameters.  Strong emphasis will be placed on idea development and craftsmanship.  Studio fee.  Prerequisite: one studio art course."

SOC,100,"This course is an introduction to sociology as a way of understanding the world. Sociology is a field of study that explains social, political, and economic phenomena in terms of social structures, social forces, and group relations. I will introduce you to the field by focusing on several important sociological topics, including socialization, culture, the social construction of knowledge, class and gender inequality, race and ethnic relations, poverty, and political sociology. Students will leave this course with an understanding of the three main sociological perspectives and several important sociological theories; the ability to apply these perspectives and theories to contemporary social problems; insight into the critical link between social structures, social forces and individual circumstances; and insight into how you shape society and how society shapes you. Additional topics covered in the course include (but are not limited to) sociological research methods, the mass media, deviance and social control, the family and intimate relationships, religion, education, the economy and work, health and medicine, urbanization, the environment, globalization, and social change. No prerequisites.

SOC,115,"This course examines the ""socially-constructed"" nature of race, ethnicity and gender by focusing on historical and contemporary articulations of race, ethnicity, class, and gender as they relate to social outcomes.  Students will explore the evolution of these categories, namely how and why they were created, and how they have changed over time.  Also, students will learn about racial and ethnic discrimination in housing, employment, banking, the criminal justice system, and other institutions.  Students will also examine the history of gender inequality in American society.  Contemporary articulations of gender inequality will be examined in the labor market, unpaid labor in the home,  U.S. childcare policy,  popular culture, and in interpersonal relationships. Additionally, this course also examines the structural causes of class inequality. Students will be exposed to the various competing theoretical perspectives regarding why we have poverty in the U.S. and explore how changes in the structure of the nation's political-economy have increased class inequality while creating the ""middle class squeeze"".  The class will also discuss  the ""financial elite"" and their role in shaping policies that exacerbate class inequality. No prerequisites."
SOC,226,"This course examines the institution of family in the United States from a sociological perspective. The sociological perspective does not assume that there is an ""ideal"" family structure. Rather, sociologists focus on the ways in which the family is a socially constructed institution that varies across time and place. We will explore how larger social forces shape how we define, organize, and experience family.  We begin by discussing the sociological conceptualization of family and examining the historical and contemporary meaning of family in the U.S. We will then turn our attention to a historical overview of the diverse family structures that existed prior to the Industrial Revolution.  Next, we examine how large scale social and historical forces spurred significant changes to the norms surrounding contemporary family structures.  The next section of the course focuses on the diversity of the contemporary family. We will examine issues including choosing a mate, parenting, marriage/partnership, tensions between paid labor and family life, the impact of social policy on families, and divorce. During the semester we will discuss similarities that exist across families.  However, we will pay special attention to how race, gender, sexuality, and class shape how we experience family.

We will explore how work reflects and helps replicate various patterns of race-gender inequality. Third, we explore how globalization, technology, and neoliberalism have engendered major changes to work in the 21st century. Specifically, we will examine labor flexibility and the spread of precariousness across a multitude of jobs/occupations. Fourth, we will examine how specific types of work/workers are relegated to the margins of the labor force. Namely, undocumented migrants, sex workers, and domestic labor will be the focus of the fourth part of the course. Finally, we will conclude by examining alternative visions for the future of work.

SOCS,109,"This course explores the system of oppression in the United States and how it is maintained.  Methods of oppression and liberation are examined through the theoretical frameworks of the cycle of socialization (Harro); models of identity formation (Cross, Tatum, Rogoff, Hardiman and Jackson); Critical Liberation Theory (Love); and the various levels and types of oppression (Katz), through which oppressive systems are maintained and sustained.  Critical thinking and analytical skills are exercised through the application of these models to each topic introduced.  Students learn to employ self-analysis and gain insights into the ways in which the self assists in the maintenance of oppression.  We closely examine social constructions of oppression and the means by which human beings are socialized to ""agree"" to and participate in spoken and unspoken cultural ""norms"" and oppressive practices. Self-analysis, individual focus, and self-reflection through regular writing assignments enable students to apply the theoretical models in a global context, extending beyond the particularities of one's individual subjective experience, geographic location, and social position.  The major topics of the course are racism, classism, religious oppression and ableism.  More specific themes include: internalized oppression and dominance, socialization, Freire and Freirian pedagogy, critical thinking, levels and types of oppression, spheres of influence and liberation.  Primary authors include: Freire, hooks, Tatum, Yeskel, Zuniga, Love, Jackson and Hardiman, Cross, Bonilla-Silva, Kumashiro, McIntosh, Kivel, and Brookfield and Preskill, to name a few."

Every student will work with a Proseminar Fellow serving as a mentor, and will attend one of the master-classes, or engage in guided reading of the works of one of the visiting scholars."
SOCS,220,"This course considers the problem of incarceration in America. The Pew Public Safety Performance Project recently released a report indicating that the United States leads the world in the number of citizens it imprisons. One in 99.1 American adults is now in a US prison or jail. Further, race, age and gender play significant roles: for example, one in every fifteen black males aged 18 or older is in prison, as opposed to one in every 106 white males. Likewise, one in every 100 black women aged 35-39 is in prison, as opposed to one in every 355 white women. We will ask, Why are so many people going to prison? What are the consequences for them and for our society?  And what might be done to change the current situation?  Through class discussions, lectures, field-work, and internships, this course will study the high rate of incarceration in the United States, different interpretations of the causes of this problem, and the effect of high rates of incarceration on the individuals involved as well as on our society. Building on what we learn, we will also talk about the ultimate question: What might be done to change things? Prerequisite: prior completion of one social science class; not open to first-semester students. This course is being co-taught by Rebecca Fiske and Ellen Lagemann."
SOCS,221,"This course focuses on the historical development of higher education in the United States as a story of growth and change accompanied by a persistent struggle for definition and identity. The course focuses on the struggles of persons, institutional types, or ideas on the ""margins"" of society to become part of the central fabric of higher education, despite the continuing dominance of elites. Historical periods associated with this course include Ancient and Medieval foundations pre-1636, Colonial higher education, gender and diversity issues in higher education, the impact of WWI and the Great Depression, the rise of the professorate, and diversification of institutional types. The class reads both primary documents as well as the work of historians. This class analyzes the shifting nature of the answers to five fundamental questions which seek to define higher education:  who should be taught; what should be taught; how should institutions be governed; who should be served; and what is the role of higher education in the larger society?  The course will also provide a review of general, liberal, technical, graduate and professional education and will explore the role of early colleges."
SOCS,223,"This seminar aims to provide students with a broad working knowledge of human rights as both an intellectual discourse and a realm of political action. Beginning with a close reading of the 1945 UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which marks the emergence of modern human rights discourse, we will discuss the roots of the UN Declaration in the French and American Revolutions, the catalyst provided by the Holocaust, and the ways in which the Declaration has been applied, extended, and frequently ignored by nations and individuals in the 50+ years since it was ratified. Specific topics, examined across a range of cultures and countries, will include torture, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, women¿s rights, and economic, social & cultural rights including the right to health and the right to development (as well as the right to avoid development). We will ask whether it is possible to establish ¿universal¿ human rights, examining the substance of critiques that human rights standards are biased in favor of Western socio-political formations, and will focus on the roles of major actors in the violations and protection of human rights, from official human rights monitoring bodies and tribunals, NGOs, national and local governments, security forces, militias and religious groups, as well as individual victims and their families and human rights activists of every stripe, including street protesters, photographers and film-makers, doctors and lawyers."
SOCS,224,"This is an intermediate level social sciences course.  Globalization is one of the defining features of the contemporary world, but there is considerable controversy regarding its nature, impact, and future trends. The goal of this course is to clarify what globalization is and how it is affecting communities around the world. This course draws upon various theoretical approaches from sociology and related disciplines to explore various issues pertaining to globalization.  Is globalization really a new phenomena or have we seen this before? Does globalization ameliorate or increase race and gender inequality? How has globalization impacted Third World countries? Is economic globalization a naturally unfolding process or are there specific groups of people directing the global economy?  What impact has globalization had on workers and organized labor? Does the West engage in cultural imperialism?  This course examines these questions and more.  Specifically, it looks at how globalization has developed recently and how it has impacted economies, nation-states, workers, gender relations, class inequality, culture, and other aspects of society.

SOCS,302,"Michel Foucault argued that we are ""individuals"" not because of our  talents and preferences,  but because we deviate in varied ways from an imposed norm; that sex is not a biological given, but an historically contingent concept used to defend ""the normal"" from ""the abnormal;"" that anything (and therefore nothing distinctive) can be deduced from the domination of the bourgeoisie;  and that therapists in liberal democracies share with the police of totalitarian dictatorships a common ancestor in medieval Christian priests.  He thus engaged in a series of provocative dialogues with other thinkers that challenged western notions of the apriori human subject; re-conceptualized the relationship of power and knowledge in academic and political discourse; and redefined what it meant to be an intellectual in the postmodern world.  Noting that Foucault's work is relevant to important new understandings of the social sciences, the arts, literary criticism, and politics, this course analyzes the fruitful encounters of his ideas with past and present critical theory; post-structuralism; and feminist and post-colonial analyses of marginalization and resistance.  It thus explores possibilities for creating a future freer and more just than the present which so exercised Foucault's iconoclastic ire.    Prerequisite: Upper Division Status or permission of the instructor.  (4 credits).

SOCS,320,"W.E.B. Du Bois not only helped define modern politics and social thought, but towers over the history, concepts, and concerns of multiple academic disciplines in both the social sciences and humanities. Interdisciplinary in his training and methods, engaged with numerous bodies of knowledge and modes of inquiry and made his contributions at the very moment in which many of these disciplines themselves were being forged. The contemporary and historical significance of color and race in the United States and beyond—problems at the heart of Du Bois's work—inform this Proseminar's consideration of his enduring intellectual and aesthetic contributions and their influence on the academy, the arts, and social and political life today. By reading Du Bois's original writings alongside the contemporary works of our guests, we will explore questions about colorism, race, and power, including but not limited to: How does color intersect with race, ethnicity, class, gender, religion, nationality, sexuality, and other social identities in ways that produce (and reproduce) inequalities and privileges in historical as well as contemporary contexts (such as cyberspace and biotechnology)? What is the relevance of Du Bois and his work for addressing the social, economic, political, and cultural inequities that constitute, and emerge from, ""the color line""?

SOCS,322,"Did God will the world into existence, and must it end with the Second Coming of Christ? Is the class struggle the motor of history, and must the end of history (sometimes Marx called it ""pre-history"") be Communism? Is competition the motor of evolution, making the fiercely competitive civilization of late nineteenth century Europe the benchmark of human development? If we might balk at the assumption that the sole purpose of our parents' lives has been to produce us, what has led us so often, in our theologies, histories, and philosophies, to posit teleological explanations such as the preceding for other human lives and events? It may be, in other words, that there was only chaos ""in the beginning;"" that it heralds no destiny for humanity, divine, natural, or rational; and that the attempt to discover the origins of things is the pursuit of a ""chimera"" (something hoped for, but impossible to achieve).
	In order better to understand our persistent fascination with beginnings and the ends they may (or may not) reveal to us, this course proposes a critical analysis of creation stories we have told ourselves in the west, from the ancient Greeks and Hebrews to the early decades of the twentieth century. We will study venerable tales of the dawn of time, modern tales of founding fathers (or Bands of Brothers, in Freud's case), and meta-narratives of biological, psychological, social, political and cultural development. Included will be texts such as The biblical book of Genesis; Hesiod's Theogony; Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality; Darwin's Origin of Species; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals; Engels' Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State; Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God; Lemaitre's A Homogeneous Universe of Constant Mass and Growing Radius; ""The Declaration of Independence;"" and Freud's Totem and Taboo. These we will read in conjunction with the works of contemporary thinkers (e.g. Michel Foucault, Stephen J. Gould, E. O. Wilson, Julia Kristeva, Donna Haraway, Francis Fukuyama, Gayle Rubin, etc.) who extend and/or critique the positions they take or imply, in an effort to appreciate how these stories of creation can inform our contemporary understandings of the human condition and its prospects. Prerequisite: Acceptance by the Division of Social Studies into the Junior Fellows Program

SOCS,323,"This seminar aims to provide students with a broad working knowledge of human rights as both an intellectual discourse and a realm of political action. Beginning with a close reading of the 1945 UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which marks the emergence of modern human rights discourse, we will discuss the roots of the UN Declaration in the French and American Revolutions, the catalyst provided by the Holocaust, and the ways in which the Declaration has been applied, extended, and frequently ignored by nations and individuals in the 50+ years since it was ratified. Specific topics, examined across a range of cultures and countries, will include torture, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, women¿s rights, and economic, social & cultural rights including the right to health and the right to development (as well as the right to avoid development). We will ask whether it is possible to establish ¿universal¿ human rights, examining the substance of critiques that human rights standards are biased in favor of Western socio-political formations, and will focus on the roles of major actors in the violations and protection of human rights, from official human rights monitoring bodies and tribunals, NGOs, national and local governments, security forces, militias and religious groups, as well as individual victims and their families and human rights activists of every stripe, including street protesters, photographers and film-makers, doctors and lawyers."
SOCS,325,"In neo-liberal capitalist societies, assertions of ownership, membership, and identity (""I own…,"" ""I belong…,"" ""I am…"") are meaningful within a particular history of social relations in which the possessive individual is imagined as a stable social category with legal standing.  In this course we consider what it means to possess (things, people, money, land, ideas, feelings, spirit) and to be possessed, how possession relates to culturally specific conceptions of value, and the ways that both relate to social formations, identity, and human being. Drawing from critical geography, anthropology, critical legal studies, critical race theory, political ecology, and philosophy, we explore the history of Western and non-Western conceptions and practices of the human and non-human, self and other, and subject and object.  While considering possible origins of (dis)possession, we study the history of ownership, labor, production,  slavery, territorialism, colonialism, racism, nationalism, and the multiple subjectivities and political conditions that continue to shape our world.

"
SOCS,328,"This course is an immersion in classic works on space and place, addressing how they are socially constructed and why that matters.  We read complete works by Henri Lefebvre (The Production of Space), Raymond Williams (The City and the Country), Gaston Bachelard (The Poetics of Space), David Harvey (Social Justice and the City), Michel Foucault (Discipline and Punish: the Birth of the Prison), Martin Heidegger (""Building, Dwelling, Thinking""), and Homi Bhabha (The Location of Culture). In addition to analyzing the location of these classics within paradigms, schools, and networks of intellectual influence, students apply the ideas most tenable for (even if contradictory to) their own new or ongoing work on projects of their own design.  Seminal topics include the production of space; spatial justice; the body, power, and discipline; recurring conceptions of the urban and the rural; the architecture of the imagination; and ""in-between"" spaces that are, as Bhabha posits, ""produced in the articulation of cultural difference.""  Our journey traverses the domains of phenomenology, cultural studies, urban theory, postcolonial theory, poststructural theory, and more. Prerequisites:  Junior or Senior standing and completion of  two 200-level courses or one 300-level course in Social Science.

"
SOCS,332,"The goal of this two-semester course is to track the coexistence and intertwinement of capitalism and colonialism. Part I posits that “the colony is always already inside capital, and capital is always already inside the colony.” This claim is examined via an extended case study of the British Empire, spurring investigation into other empires of the modern age and comparisons to older imperialisms. The colonial search for home—and romance of being at home everywhere in the world—produced a very specific moral and political economy that traversed entire oceans and needed nourishment and maintenance through subjugation and forced hospitality in the colony and metropole alike. The goals of this course are for students to recognise the political, philosophical, economic, social, and cultural systems that together materialise these lifeworlds. Part II of this sequence (offered in the subsequent semester) examines the undoing or unmaking of the colony, a process that has required more than passing of laws and drawing of boundaries. Students are not required to take both courses, and can only sign up for one semester at a time. Prerequisites:  Sophomore Standing and one 200-level or above course in social studies, or sophomore standing and permission of instructor. 

"
SOCS,333,"(While this is part two of a yearlong curriculum studying capitalism and colonialism, part one [SOCS 332] is NOT a pre-requisite for this course).
This course probes the entanglement and interpenetration of capitalism and colonialism into the unfinished era of decolonisation and well into the postcolony. It tracks the emergence of anticolonial movements, their claims, philosophies, and tactics, and their relations to struggles against capitalism. We examine the intersecting genealogies of capitalism and colonialism by proceeding from peoples’ resistance to them. We delve into how people have articulated their desires, positions, friends, allies, and enemies, and how their ideas and actions have exposed the roots, destinies, convergences, and divergences of anti-colonial and anti-capitalist politics. In this course, special emphasis is placed on apprehending the variations of political method within and across these struggles, and also at different levels of materiality, visibility, and legibility. Thus, an examination of the literary, philosophical, and artistic movements that emerge in anticolonial struggles is central to understanding the broader poetics and aesthetics of anticolonialism, anticapitalism, nationalism, and internationalism. While students build their own archives for inquiry around areas/movements of their choosing, our collective efforts draw on an abundant and hospitable canon of anticolonial and anticapitalist life, thought, and movement histories new and old, from Haiti to Occupy Wall Street, from Australia to Palestine. A hope is that at the end of this course, we might be more able to (1) question the premises shared by colonialism and capitalism and the political thought and imperatives they have naturalized, (2) avoid the trap of separating out the histories of various contemporary oppressions everywhere from the seemingly “local” histories of colonialism and capitalism, and (3) produce political action that does not sacrifice thought. Prerequisites: Sophomore Standing and one 200-level or above course in social studies, or sophomore standing and permission of instructor."
SOCS,334,"The ""Anthropocene"" is a recently proposed geological epoch defined by predominant human influence on the biosphere and atmosphere. This course interrogates the nature, discursive origins, and contested imperatives of the ""epoch of (hu)man(ity)"" while exploring questions of responsibility in the age of anthropogenic global warming, rising sea levels, coastal evacuation, drought, and social dislocation. Is anthropos (man) the outraged protagonist, the avaricious antagonist, or both? This confusion may best be captured by the French word ""outrage"" - meaning scandal and violation. Can human authority over myriad terrestrial and atmospheric processes sustain a home on a warming planet in a cold cosmos? Can home, the oikos in economy and ecology, provide a foundation for action and responsibility to humans and the more-than-human? Does capitalism promote collective environmental justice and resilience? Will militarization become the standard response to ""waves/flows/floods"" (racist, xenophobic inundation metaphors abound) of ""refugees,"" and other socio-ecological crises, real and imagined? Prerequisites: At least one 200-level course in social studies and the completion of Seminar III."
SOCS,010A,"Advancements in biological technology present us with new ethical challenges because they give us powers we did not previously have. Through technology we can save some people's lives for little cost, spend immense amounts of money to prolong the lives of others, test fetuses for genetic abnormalities, keep people alive beyond the ability of their organs to function independently, and gestate fetuses in surrogates. Possible future technological developments with significant ethical implications include: the development of artificial intelligence; the ability to genetically engineer new organisms, resurrect extinct species, and genetically enhance humans; and the ability to 'design' our offspring. We will examine ethical questions such as: Should doctors always tell the unadulterated truth to their patients? Is it ethical to abort fetuses because they have genetic abnormalities? If we can create humans with enhanced intelligence or clone a Neanderthal, should we?"
SOCS,011A,"Founded by Alexander the Great in 332 BCE, the city of Alexandria in Egypt would become most famous for its Library and Lighthouse. For almost three centuries it was the center of a remarkable flourishing of science and scholarship in the ancient Mediterranean world. In this course we study the origins of the city, in Alexander’s conquest of the vast Persian Empire, as well as the city’s decline and eventual fall, during the reign of Cleopatra. Special attention will be give to the Library of Alexandria - what it contained, how it was collected and organized, and what kind of work went on there. Throughout the course we maintain an interest in the complex relationships among Greeks, Persians, and Egyptians, how they viewed each other, their customs and religions, and how their interactions gave rise to one of the most influential civilizations of the ancient world."
SOCS,012A,"Due to their strategic positioning on the Eurasian continent, Russia and Eastern Europe have long played a pivotal role on the world stage.  This course will serve as an introduction to the history, traditions, and culture of Eastern European civilizations. While we will begin with a brief overview of the geography of the region and its early history, the bulk of the course will be organized around a unifying theme of revolution, highlighting some of the twentieth century revolutions that occurred in Eastern Europe, the political and artistic dissident movements that gave rise to them, and the ultimate post-1989 aftermath that led to contemporary societies as we see them today."
SOCS,01A,"The Bard Academy ninth grade Global Slavery course focuses on the question of how human beings have and still do become the property of other human beings and why that ownership matters.  The course serves as a rigorous introduction to standards and culture of the Academy in the Social Sciences.  The course is thematically designed around problem-oriented modules ranging across historical and contemporary issues. Each module has a series of exercises and a guided writing assignment intended to provoke curiosity, facilitate inquiry, and document emerging understandings of the material as teenage citizens of the contemporary global economy.  

"
SOCS,02A,"This course explores sacred cities from an historic and contemporary perspective. Urban centers found across the world, sacred cities are important to the history or faith of one or multiple religions. Examination of these cities will permit students to become familiar with the tenets of those religions that claim these urban centers as significant. We will come to understand how one city, for example Jerusalem or Katmandu, might be sacred to multiple faiths, such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam or Buddhism, Hinduism, and Sikhism respectively. We furthermore consider the implications of this shared and continuing importance. We will also learn how sacred cities, like Mecca (Saudi Arabia) or Varanasi (India), become centers for pilgrimage and how certain cities, for instance Córdoba (Spain) and Touba (Senegal), increase or decrease in importance for followers, in this case Islam, throughout time and according to circumstance. Lastly, we explore Yoruba religion in Ife, Nigeria in order to then become familiar with syncretic religions, beliefs and practices that blend various faith systems, in the Americas. Syncretic religions and sacred cities examined include the practice of Santería in Havana (Cuba) and Candomblé in Salvador (Brazil)."
SOCS,03A,"The media is all around us and we are actively and passively a part of it; but are we fully aware of the media’s effects? This course will provide students with the knowledge and tools to develop critical consciousness of the various forms of media. Questions addressed will include: How can propaganda be used to promote different kinds of pro-social and/or anti-social behaviors? What impact do Disney and Mattel have on children's socialization? How does the media shape our beliefs about people from demographics we do not share? Television shows, advertisements, video games and other forms of media “entertainment” will be examined.  Specifically, we will explore the use of media in transatlantic nations while asking critical questions about how people, issues, events and values are represented and how this representation impacts our thinking."
SOCS,04A,"In this course, the various founding documents of the United States of America – the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the 27 Amendments to the Constitution (which is therefore often called a ""living document"") – will serve as occasions for exploring US and global history.  We will focus on the social, political, economic, and cultural struggles through which these documents came to be, and examine how events shaped the documents and how the documents, in turn, shaped events, requiring us to switch perspectives and angles. We will thus discover and contrast both the United States envisioned in these documents, and the United States that is revealed when studying their historical context and development.  Thus will we discover something of the deeper historical forces and the interaction of ordinary people and institutions.  We will ask how do these key moments constitute the US and its history? How and where do such ""founding"" documents live, and who gives life to a living document?"
SOCS,05A,"An argument is the presentation of evidence for a conclusion. Some arguments are persuasive; some are not. We will learn how to analyze the structure of arguments, how to determine whether they are persuasive, and--when they are not--how to argue that they are not. In addition, we will study how to construct persuasive arguments of our own and present them clearly and effectively in writing. We will study deductive, inductive, scientific, and statistical reasoning. Examples will be drawn from politics, science, philosophy, and fiction."
SOCS,06A,"Have you ever read a statistic and wondered, “How did the researchers figure that out?” Statistical and observational findings are reported daily in media outlets, but how much should one trust the results? How do we explain a result that does not support the hypothesis?  Students in this course will explore the science of social science as we conduct research in Anthropology, Sociology, Psychology and Economics. Taking a hands-on approach, students learn about the benefits and challenges therein as we practice the general principles of collecting, analyzing and reporting information in the social sciences.


"
SOCS,07A,"Philosophical thought experiments and paradoxes challenge our everyday thinking about the world and our place in it. In this course, we will examine classic thought experiments and paradoxes including The Trolley Problem, Brains in Vats, Descartes' demon, Twin Earth, Newcomb's problem, Zeno's paradoxes, Hilbert's Hotel, Teletransportation, Sorites, The Surprise Examination, The Ship of Theseus, Doomsday, and Sleeping Beauty. In reacting to these puzzles, we will learn how to analyze the structure of arguments, determine whether they are persuasive, and--when they are not--argue that they are not. In addition, we will study how to construct persuasive arguments of our own and present them clearly and effectively in writing. The course serves as an introduction both to the content and methods of philosophy."
SOCS,08A,"This course introduce students to some of the classic theories and works on adolescences, particularly those in the Social Sciences. Beginning with some of the early work on adolescence (e.g, G. Stanley Hall's ""storm and stress"" view of the stage, and Margaret Mead's famous work, ""Coming of Age in Samoa""), and then moving into some of the mid-century work, including Berkshire resident and famous psychologist, Erik Erikson, as well as contemporary debates (e.g., around the ""invention"" of adolescence). Sources for discussion and inspiration about adolescence will include social science theory and research, as well as some classic novels about adolescence, such as The Catcher in the Rye, To Kill A Mockingbird, and Anne Frank's The Diary of a Young Girl, as well as films, such as Moonlight and Heathers. The course aims also to expose students to a variety of perspectives within the social sciences--psychology, anthropology, history, sociology, politics--through the lens of studying and learning about adolescence."
SOCS,09A,"This course is about the cultures, histories, and lives of Native Americans in North America.  We will start with an overview of what life was like for Native peoples at about the time that Europeans first arrived and invaded these lands. And then we will talk about some of the patterns of change that occurred after their arrival.  We will then shift our focus to talk about several specific societies And we will emphasize the current lives of Native peoples residing on reservations and in urban communities in the United States and Canada.  The readings will include autobiographies written by Native people that help us understand their lives today. We will also watch a number of documentaries about Native life.

SOCS,230M,"The work of James Baldwin provides an exemplary, timeless, and acute lens on the politics of the United States. This course follows Baldwin’s many genres of expression and interlocution—plays, poetry, novels, essays, film and more—to get a sense of the complexity of the claim to be a native son who does not have a country of his own. Baldwin invites, even necessitates, a close analysis of the full scope of race and its politics and anti-politics in the US, by assessing the trends that he instantiates, institutes, and reacts to in his large corpus of work—not to mention the matter of relating to what refuses to relate to you, and to the home one either burns down or chooses to leave. Apart from Baldwin’s own key writings, his correspondence with others is taken up. Selected secondary literature is paired with readings for every week to bring out the full impact of the political and cultural forces within which he is etched. We consult not only Baldwin’s literal contemporaries but also those who fall into a more varied and imaginative genealogical web with him.  Over the course of the semester, students are asked to write and perform in a way that engages and interacts explicitly with Baldwin’s many voices. The class will meet once a week at a time that works for the enrolled participants.

SPAN,318,"Cervantes' novel has been the topic of great controversies ever since its publication in 1605.  Whether used to criticize their own societies or reminiscent about a glorious past, Don Quijote has intrigued and fascinated generations of intellectuals since the beginning.

SPAN,321,"The realist novel served as an outlet for social and political commentary by the authors who sought change in the midst of turmoil and revolt.  In Spain, the realist novel also served, as its counterpart in France, to criticize and expose the petty desires and materialism of the new bourgeois class.  The city, with the planning of Baron Haussmann, became the place to see and be seen.  Then came the building of the modern department store, which in turn, eliminated the family-run establishments that had been handed down for generations.  Consumerism and the role men and women had in balancing the new power structure served as key elements in the success of the department store, the source of the economic transition.
	This course examines several novels written between 1850 - 1895 that deal with the emergence of the ""modern"" city and consumerist culture.  Each novel explores the impact of the newly-established department store on the lives of the city bourgeoisie who were anxious to ""see and be seen.""  We explore the attitudes of the men who ""wore"" women and the women who bought the clothes men sold in Madrid and Paris and the effects this had on the local businesses and recent rural migrants.

Authors include: Rosalía de Castro, Benito Pérez Galdós, Emile Zola, Gustave Flaubert, Leopoldo Alas Clarín, and Ángel Ganivet.

SPAN,326,"Prostitution is, as the saying goes, the oldest profession in the world.  If that is the case, then the brothel is the oldest business.  In the world of Hispanic fiction, the brothel is the place where key events concerning their plots and characters take place.  In Hispanic literature, the prostitute has maintained her superior status over other women because she has had the freedom to control her body and her money.This course examines a selection of literary texts from the Hispanic world (Spain and America) to evaluate the role that the prostitute - and the brothel - plays in these societies.  Jo Labanyi suggests that a novel serves as a starting point for the societal changes that an author wants to make.  According to this theory, the role that the prostitute has in literature seems to mirror her position in society.  We do not seek to solve a problem, rather to study the importance that writers from the 15th to the 20th century have seen in a profession that has been condemned as a problem.  We will see that the ¿alcahueta¿ in Fernando de Rojas' novel is the only character capable of making decisions and living as she pleases while Vargas Llosa's ¿la brasileña¿ serves as the outlet for one man's sexual frustrations.  This polarity in the function of the prostitute is only the beginning in a study of a complex character that has influenced societal changes by the ambiguity of its role in it."

Seminar III centers on the rapid transformations from 1850 to the late twentieth century, as boundaries are established and broken in various fields of inquiry and widespread diasporas in multiple directions blur boundaries in national identities toward a more global, international outlook."
SST,251-B,"BARD COURSE: It has now been more than fifty years since the original work of Stanley Milgram demonstrated the remarkable and widely unpredicted findings that large numbers of individuals in multiple samples of American men and women studied were willing to ""punish"" another person when ordered to do so by an experimenter; this in the stated but false context of a psychology experiment on learning and memory.  The prominence of the initial work and the continued salience of such study and accumulated findings in the domain of social psychology cannot be over-stated.  And it very much has not reached the stage of dormancy as the publication of studies, reviews and conferences on the topic of obedience to authority continue to appear in unabated fashion. In addition, a search of current psychology or cross disciplinary archives can uncover still further studies and demonstrations that provide evidence that obedience, and indeed destructive obedience, is very much prevalent in our society and in many others as well. Further revealing of prominence is the fact that a new full-length movie version of the original study has recently been released and has received remarkable attention and  review. Over the course of the semester a sizable portion of the work contained in the body of obedience literature is reviewed from the perspective of trying to assess the continuing status of the phenomenon and to understand the explanations that have been brought to light. There will also be 6-7 Sunday evening sessions with guest speakers. Admission to the course is by permission of the instructor - maximum class size 12 (with 4 seats reserved for interested Simon’s Rock students)."

THEA,100,"The ability to play is the heart of all performance, yet most performers believe it to be the frivolous activity of children. Because imagination can be perceived as the enemy of analysis, improvisation often strikes terror in the hearts of even the most experienced performers. Through a carefully crafted sequence of exercises, this course challenges these concepts and rekindles the performer's ability to play, imagine, and improvise. These qualities are introduced and developed as techniques for performance and analysis. Habitual responses, cultural influences, and status are examined with exercises in self-awareness, observation, and personal reflection. An excellent fundamental course for students from all backgrounds. No prerequisites. This course is a prerequisite for most upper level theater courses."
THEA,104,"In this module, each student develops one or more roles, culminating in a black box production of a one-act play or a series of multiple short plays. By going through the production process from start to finish, students learn how to
research, develop, rehearse, and perform a role in a play, balancing each individual's needs with those of the group. Through limited participation in technical and managerial aspects of the production, students gain a deeper awareness of the teamwork necessary for any theatrical endeavor. This module is intended for students who have not yet taken the 200-level Production Course. Previous theater experience is recommended but not required."
THEA,107,"This module is concerned with the faculty-supervised, student-generated, dramatic endeavor. This project is realized with limited technical support and is intended to be an intensive interface between the student director, the student performers, and the faculty supervisor. The student actors and stage managers involved are introduced to the principles and elements of performance without the rigors of the faculty-directed, semester-long project. Generally, the content of the performance is equivalent to a one-act play. This course includes some basic research and readings pertaining to acting/directing theory and texts related to the performance material(s) themselves. A paper is due at the end of the module and all students are expected to fulfill their assigned duties and adhere to the rehearsal schedule. Almost all rehearsal occurs during class time, with the direct supervision of the faculty instructor. This module is intended as an introductory course in the theater program. It has no prerequisites for any participating student, except for the student director. The student director must have the instructor's permission."
THEA,108,"This is a hands on course where students will learn the process and general skills needed for theatrical costume and prop execution from inception to finished product.  They will learn to assess a play for its needs; research time periods and places, and adapt them to a play.  Strong emphasis will be placed on planning effectively in order to produce real costumes and props for a given play, as envisioned by a director, within a budget and a proscribed period of time.  Some time will be spent on getting input from a director, actors and other designers, using that information in a design concept and getting final approval before starting.  Along with methods of effective research and planning, students will be exposed to the rudimentary skills needed to find, purchase, adapt and/or construct costumes and props."
THEA,109,"Light is both a fundamental force of our universe and a fundamental part of our human existence.  Through light we experience our world, understand shape, know the time of day, and can be made to feel elated, frightened, or angry.  In the theatre, lighting has tremendous dramaturgical power.  It can tell us location, create mood, raise tension, or put us at peace.  In this class we will learn how to really see light, connect our experiences with light to a text and create lighting environments to best express the dramaturgy of that text.  Some theatre experiene is helpful but not required."
THEA,111,"The scenes in a play form the structural building blocks of the entire play. Through the performative and analytical study of scenes, actors can learn tools for approaching the playing of a character through the entire arc of a play. In
this course, we will work on scenes from contemporary plays learning and employing practical tools for analyzing text, developing character and working with a partner. Actors will learn how to work without a director, what questions
to ask when preparing a role and how to listen and truly respond to one's fellow actor."
THEA,115,"This course, co-taught by the College's technical theatre and design faculty, will introduce students to the wide variety of specializations in technical theater and production design, including but not limited to the following: set design and building, scenic painting, lighting, sound, costume design, make up, stage management, and front-of-house production will be explored. These different areas and their relationships to one another and to the end result of a finished production.  The course will also provide opportunity for students to gain practical experience in many of these areas.  Students will be required to augment their coursework with hands-on ""lab"" work in the semester's theater program productions and/or on other performing arts events."
THEA,117,"This course introduces the Viewpoints to actors of all levels. The Viewpoints are tools which allow the actor to become an active collaborator in the artistic process, empowering him/her to open his/her awareness during performance to
the innumerable possibilities of each moment. Through a series of group and individual exercises actors will learn this technique and apply it to text. No prerequisite. This course is a prerequisite for most upper level theater courses."
THEA,118,"This course will provide advanced knowledge in the theories of drafting, constructing, handling and moving various types of stage scenery.  The successful student will be able to demonstrate an understanding and appreciation of the advanced technology inherent in the theatre.  Students will be expected to develop problem solving skills through the use of research, thought, discussion and the use of standard theatrical conventions.  Open discussions will provide opportunities for questions and exchanges of related topics."
THEA,119,"This course will introduce the student to the fundamentals of theatrical lighting technology. Lighting is a vital part of the production process and the technology is getting more and more complex. We will cover the basics of lighting instruments,
control consoles, dimmer systems, control software, and dimming technology as well as introduce the basics of intelligent lighting instruments and tools."
THEA,126,"The techniques needed to create story, character and setting from improvisation are the focus of this course. The skills for creating as an improvisor, a classical actor and a writer are all built on the same foundations: the ability to follow creative impulses without censorship.  This course challenges performance concepts and develops the student’s imagination, improvisational and performance skills and ability to develop narrative in the medium of theatre.  We will devise theatre from sources such as current events, visual image and personal experience.  As these qualities are introduced they will be developed as techniques for performance, writing and analysis of the process of devising theatre.  We will focus on techniques for effective collaboration as writers, directors, producers and performers. Students will have the opportunity to experience all aspects of the process of creating and performing original theatre as they support each other’s work, develop individual talents and develop their understanding of the complex art of theatre.  Texts will be performed at the end of the semester.  Students can expect to develop their collaborative, leadership and communication skills. No prerequisite.

Dionysian festivals to modern day Broadway. Beginning with the Greek theater we will explore the theatrical impulse through the ages. No prerequisites."
THEA,139,"Over the course of the semester we will explore the art of theater design, particularly as it relates to the collaboration with directors. We will look at the various forms of theater design: set, costume, lighting and sound and at how the
director and the various designers of a production together create an organic, unified world in which the play can be revealed to the audience. The design team of our Theater program production will be involved with the course as guest lecturers and the class will observe the Director/Designer collaboration of this production as it evolves. We will also study one classic and one modern text as
we explore our own director/designer collaborations. No prerequisites."
THEA,146,"With the growing presence of projections as a significant element of modern performance, projection designers have become a vital member of the design team. The advent of this technology comes with a new set of questions about the potential of visual elements to expand and support the vision of the performance makers. This course examines current practices and strategies being implemented in the field of projection design, while also addressing the risks inherent in new technology of upstaging performance. In addition to studying the work of current projection designers working in the field, students are asked to design projections for various theatrical texts and engage with the work of their peers through in-class critiques. Through this course students gain both the skills necessary to pursue future projection designs along with a better understanding of the role of the projection designer as a collaborative member of the design team."
THEA,201,"Text is the medium of the actor's art and must be thorougly understood by the performer. A clear understanding is the result of careful analysis of the play as a whole: finding clues to the character (the point of view), realizing the state of the character before and after the scene, and an understanding of how each character contributes to the overall meaning of the play. Such analysis along with the examination of acting theory developed after the turn of the century are the focus of this course. Prerequisite: Theater 100 or Theater 117, or permission of the instructor."
THEA,202,"Vocal exercises condition both mind and body, enabling the actor to express the visceral and intellectual potential of any text, whether classical or modern. In this course students learn actors' vocal warm-up techniques and the concept underlying each exercise in the progression. All contribute to breath control, since breath is germane to speaking and carries the impulse of thought and feeling into each word. Learning to understand the impact of character and the function of figures of speech in dramatic form are other aspects of the course; students build their skills by presenting poetry and prose to the class, and finally by preparing and performing two contrasting monologues (one classical and one modern) in a setting designed to mimic that of a professional audition. Prerequisite: Theater 100 or Theater 117, or permission of the instructor."
THEA,204,"This course, an introduction to movement as both therapy and expression, enables the performer to understand relationships among thought, feeling, and gesture.

THEA,246,"At the end of the nineteenth century, Konstantin Stanislavski and his Moscow Art Theatre astonished the world with productions of Anton Chekhov¿s plays which were unlike anything anyone had previously seen in the theatre. Stanislavski¿s techniques of acting broke from a tradition of declaiming and led theatre artists into a new world of realism. For the entire twentieth century, theatre artists, especially in America, have struggled to understand the complexities of Stanislavski¿s techniques. His method of actor training developed and grew over the years of his work in the theatre and by the end of his life, he was working with ¿physical action¿ in a way that foreshadowed much of the work of the avante-garde theatre companies today. Over the course of the semester we will use Anton Chekhov¿s play /The Cherry Orchard/ to explore the tools of acting that Stanislavski introduced. Through presentations given by the students, we will place our work within the context of the late nineteenth century/early twentieth century Russian political, cultural, and social world as well as looking at what was happening in the theatre worldwide when Stanislavski revolutionized it with his teachings and productions.

THEA,334,"Did you know that ""Directors"" never even existed in the theater until the 20th century? Or that early theater was performed in the open air or had open roofs using sunlight for lighting? Or that our modern ""Mardi Gras"" is related to the Medieval Mystery Plays? Designed for theater majors and non-majors--anyone interested in theater--this course traces the development of western theater from
Dionysian festivals to modern day Broadway. Beginning with the Greek theater we will explore the theatrical impulse through the ages. No prerequisites."
THEA,338,"The art of Directing is a relatively new art form in the theatre, dating back only as far as the turn of the Twentieth Century. Before Directors emerged to lead companies of actors and interpret scripts, plays were directed by the playwrights or by the actors themselves. In the first part of this course, we will study the development of the art of Directing from Stanislavski through Bertolt Brecht and Peter Brook and ending with modern directors such as Anne Bogart. In the second part of the course students will direct each other in scenes, applying tools we have studied and discussed and working toward a creative method of their own which they can use in future projects.Prerequisite: Class in theatre or instructor approval"
THEA,339,"Over the course of the semester we will explore the art of theater design, particularly as it relates to the collaboration with directors. We will look at the various forms of theater design: set, costume, lighting and sound and at how the
director and the various designers of a production together create an organic, unified world in which the play can be revealed to the audience. The design team of our Theater program production will be involved with the course as guest lecturers and the class will observe the Director/Designer collaboration of this production as it evolves. We will also study one classic and one modern text as
we explore our own director/designer collaborations. No prerequisites."
THEA,401,"This course is designed for students of the theater who have completed the introductory courses. The technique of text analysis, physical and vocal characterization, ensemble playing, and emotional truth in playing will be synthesized in the performance of a faculty-directed play.

how to embody and personalize the verse. Prerequisites: Production for the 300-level course; Performance Practicum for the 400-level course.
"
THEA,402,"The theory and technique explored in this course are designed to give the actor comic performance skills. The clown¿s ability to believe anything and perform from a point of view that challenges putative reality strengthens imagination and concentration. Texts and improvisation are the basis for each participant to explore the humor and also the tragedy, that is often at the center of the ¿laugh.¿ Each actor uses clown, mask, and acting exercises to create comic characters and explore the humanity that is the basic element of comedy. Prerequisite: Theater 305 or permission of the instructor."
THEA,403,"This course allows intermediate and advanced students to benefit from each other's contributions in improvisation and text work, and culminates with the in-depth exploration of a scene from Shakespeare.

THEA,409,"Light is both a fundamental force of our universe and a fundamental part of our human existence.  Through light we experience our world, understand shape, know the time of day, and can be made to feel elated, frightened, or angry.  In the theatre, lighting has tremendous dramaturgical power.  It can tell us location, create mood, raise tension, or put us at peace.  In this class we will learn how to really see light, connect our experiences with light to a text and create lighting environments to best express the dramaturgy of that text.  Some theatre experiene is helpful but not required."

THEA,224M,"This course focuses on the unique challenges of acting for film, particularly in the close-up. Acting for film requires an astute awareness of one's close-up presence in front of the camera. Through analyzing multiple takes of a single scene, students in this class are exposed to new ways of working and learn how subtle shifts and adjustments can alter the emotional impact of their performance. Throughout this course, students are filmed performing scenes from existing screenplays and are encouraged to consider how to portray a wide array of characters beyond those that are ""close to self."" Through engaging in a process of group critique of multiple takes of scenes performed by their peers, students develop a critical eye for the development of this work and are able to apply these insights to their own performances."

WS,303,"This course serves as an introductory survey of the challenges faced by women in six major regions of the world: Africa, China, India, the Middle East, Latin America, North America, and Europe. Students read one or more works of literature by women from each region as windows into the culture from a woman¿s perspective, supplemented by readings in feminist and postcolonial theory, as well as historical and cultural background, designed to provide a broader understanding of the situation of women in each cultural context. Each student also undertakes an extended Inquiry Log research project, in which s/he engages more deeply with global feminist issues, comparing and contrasting women¿s roles, issues and political movements in one or two countries from one or two regions of the world. Students are encouraged to consult primary documents whenever possible, for example UNIFEM or Amnesty International reports, or information from women¿s organizations from various countries that may be available on-line, when language permits. Frequent classroom visits from relevant members of the international community at Simon¿s Rock also help to ¿bring the world home¿ for the seminar group. Students present their Inquiry Log research twice during the semester, and write up their findings in a series of three papers, each a minimum of 10 pages. Students are also required to write a series of four five-page response papers on the primary texts. In recent years, readings have included works by Jung Chang, Nawal El Saadawi, Buchi Emecheta, Fatima Mernissi, Aurora Levins Morales, Margaret Randall, Adrienne Rich, Gayatri C.

WS,205M,"In her 1938 volume Three Guineas, Virginia Woolf famously proclaimed that ""as a woman, I have no country; as a woman I want no country; as a woman, my country is the whole world,"" a rebellious blasting of conventional boundaries that her literary descendants Adrienne Rich, Audre Lorde and Gloria Anzaldua would also take up in various ways. This course takes its title from Lorde’s influential 1984 volume of essays, Sister Outsider, in which she fearlessly
interrogates multiple interlocking individual and systemic oppressions based on race, class, gender and sexuality. We’ll read essays and poetry by Jewish feminist Adrienne Rich, who validated the importance for feminists of continuing to see the world ""through outsider's eyes,"" and take up Chicana queer activist Anzaldua’s prescient call to make the psychic and physical landscape of the ""borderlands"" a space of liberation. Sister Outsiders offers an introduction to the work of four influential feminist writers, who together laid the groundwork for contemporary feminist/queer theory and advanced our understanding of the complex interplay of gender and power in society."
WS,215M,"In 2018 the #MeToo movement brought issues of workplace harassment and sexual assault into the public eye, across a wide spectrum of industries from Hollywood to Ford. It seems that the gendered balance of power is beginning to shift in women's favor, and yet in so many arenas women still face daunting obstacles to leadership success. This course provides an introduction to the theory and practice of women's leadership, exploring some of the stories that circulate in our culture around women and power, taking into account women’s intersectional positioning on the axes of race & ethnicity, class, gender, sexual preference, nationality, etc. We will collaborate with students at Bard/Annandale and the Bard/Holyoke Micro-college to produce an online magazine on the topic of Women & Leadership and to organize a one-day Women & Leadership Summit at Simon’s Rock, including presentations by experienced women leaders from a variety of fields."
WS,270M,"Since colonial times, Latin American and Caribbean women have been struggling to negotiate the complex hierarchy of race/class/gender oppressions and to carve out autonomous spaces and independent voices for themselves. These interdisciplinary modular courses will draw on the discourses of history, politics, sociology, and economics, as well as a blend of feminist, postcolonial and literary theory, to explore a series of non-canonical works, including testimonials, novels, poetry and essays, by contemporary women writers of Latin America and the Caribbean. Special attention will be paid to the themes of political and economic disenfranchisement, the intertwining of racism, sexism, elitism and imperialism, environmental justice, and the ways each author meshes politics and aesthetics in her work."
